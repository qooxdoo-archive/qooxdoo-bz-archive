            <thetext>There are both debug messages and warnings displayed in the console when data URLs are used. Neither should be displayed in this case. The warnings are intended to identify non-functioning &quot;source&quot; values, but data URLs do not require the notification.</thetext>

    Elminate the message in the debug console, when loading data URLs
    
    - This fixes messages that occur in two places:
    
      1. qx.bom.element.Decoration prints a warning if the format of an image is
         unknown. That occurred because qx.io.ImageLoader.getFormat() didn&#39;t take
         data URLs into account.
    
      2. qx.ui.basic.Image printed a debug message for unmanaged images if the
         source string didn&#39;t begin with &quot;http&quot;. It now also allows the source to
         begin with &quot;data:image/&quot;.</thetext>

&gt; Thanks for the fix Derrell. Don&#39;t you think that could also be usable for the
&gt; branch as this is a bug fix and not an enhancement, right?

I don&#39;t know. Does removing a serious annoyance count as a bug fix or an enhancement? :-)

My own feeling is that changes to branch should be only true bug fixes, which this doesn&#39;t really count as in my mind. If you want me to apply it to branch too, let me know and I will.

Thats a good question but lets face it from the other side, is the new behavior better and does not break the old? From that point of view I would say yes and it should go into branch. But you are totally right, it is an edge case and both ways are ok.

I would apply it because it could also help people using the branch release. As you said, the message is annoying and could be seen as a bug as well.

Ok, I applied the commit to branch as well:

            <thetext>Reopening. My patch was broken. If the image hasn&#39;t been loaded yet, i.e. entry=this.__data[source] is undefined, it&#39;s clearly not acceptable to dereference entry.</thetext>
