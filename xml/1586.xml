            <thetext>The Editable property was dropped in .8 but is needed. In an application where all the ComboBoxes look the same but some are editable and some are not, using a SelectBox for the non-editable ones will not work as they don&#39;t look the same. I need to be able to simply set a property and make the control non-editable.</thetext>

            <thetext>Hi Jim, those two widgets do look different intentionally: a combo box is merely a text field with an associated list of suggested values, while the select box allows for choosing a pre-defined value. Both widgets therefore also have specific APIs.

If you are interested in a more identical look of the two (while I think the current theming makes sense), you may change the appearance. I guess your UI isn&#39;t so dynamic that your input elements change between select and combo boxes due to user interaction, but if they do, you would have to switch widgets, I suppose.

Will this work for you?

            <thetext>Jim, I think you solved it specifically in your app? Let me know, I would then set this to WONTFIX, ok?</thetext>

            <thetext>Jim, this bug report is stale. I recall you found a solution back then (right?), so I set this to WONTFIX.</thetext>
