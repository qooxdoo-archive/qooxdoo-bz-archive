            <thetext>I believe there&#39;s a problem with Disabled ListItems not being consistently selected programatically.

The playground example above demonstrates the problem, I believe. After a few seconds all the items are disabled and selected, yet when you scroll up/down you&#39;ll see some blocks are not selected.

In the application that I&#39;m working on I have a few disabled items, and it&#39;s important that they are displayed selected or unselected. However, most of the time they aren&#39;t being shown selected.

[I&#39;ve done a bit of troubleshooting, and the items are being immediately being removed from the selection array by a listener by the looks of it]

Thanks!
