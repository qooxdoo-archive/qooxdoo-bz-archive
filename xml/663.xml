            <thetext>Under some circumstances the default Firefox context menu is shown even though it should have been disabled by calls to stopPropagation and preventDefault.

Tools &gt; Options, Content, Advanced JS options has &quot;Disable or replace context menus&quot; checked however a right-click shows the qooxdoo-generated context menu underneath the browser menu. Single-stepping the code shows that the browser menu appears after the event has been processed.

This appears to be dependent on circumstances. A &quot;build&quot; version doesn&#39;t show it, the &quot;source&quot; version does. And then it stops altogether.

See http://www.nabble.com/Context-menu-in-Firefox-not-suppressed-in-0.7.2--tf4507833.html for a discussion and reports from other users.

            <thetext>That sounds new to me. Interesting however. We will need more time for investigation here. Changed target to 0.7.3.</thetext>

            <thetext>For us (the RAP project, http://eclipse.org/rap) it would be *highly* desirable to get this fixed until our 1.0 release is due on Oct, 10.
Is there any timeframe yet?</thetext>

            <thetext>Summary: The bug is that the context menu is sometimes shown even when it is disabled globally using the qooxdoo EventHandler.

I have tested some examples and in all examples I have seen this works OK. Hugh, can you please reopen the bug and attach an example (which reproduceable does not work) when this bug is still there. Thanks alot.</thetext>

            <thetext>I haven&#39;t seen this problem for quite a while despite a lot of testing under Firefox in the source mode.

Something must have happened to fix it.

Therefore you can close it if you want.

I haven&#39;t seen the native context menu for quite a while, so I&#39;m asking
that the bug is closed.
