            <thetext>Hi,

I noticed a annoying bug with the virtualtree scrollbars.

When a big tree is deployed, the scrollbars may eventually appear. After that, it is sometimes impossible to get back to the top or the bottom of the tree when not using the &quot;arrows buttons&quot; but only the dragable bar.

There&#39;s no need of a playground example as this behaviour occurs in the demobrowser. In the first example of &quot;tree virtual&quot;, if we deploy the spam folder and then use the dragable bar, it isn&#39;t anymore possible to reach the top of the tree.

Regards,

Benoît.</thetext>

            <thetext>Some precisions about this behavior: it seems that when the scroll is done very slowly, it is actually possible to reach the extrema.

I&#39;ve heard of some modifications recently done to the scroll component in order to enhance usability by decreasing the number of scrolling event&#39;s calls... 

Might it be the reason of that new problem ? 

Best,

Benoît.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report Benoît. Maybe it has something to do with the changes we made recently. I&#39;ll check this and post my feedback here.</thetext>

            <thetext>I was seeing similar problems yesterday. The scrollbars weren&#39;t disappearing, but I was unable to scroll to the extrema of the table. Pulling latest svn today has solved the problem for me.

            <thetext>This seems indeed to be related to bug #3824, so I reopened this one as well.</thetext>

            <thetext>Currently this is not an issue because I reverted the code which brought up this problem. We should only take care of this behavior if we apply another patch. But there is no need for keeping a bug open that we don&#39;t want to introduce again.</thetext>
