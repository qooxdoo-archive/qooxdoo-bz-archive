            <thetext>Text selection events are caught and remixed with widget events causing annoying and/or incoherent behavior.

For example, using the 0.7.3 showcase [1] (report&#39;s URL), one can:
 * Select tool bar text [2] while navigating through the menu itself (with the mouse button kept down);
 * Select button text [2];
 * Quickly dragging columns [3] [4] selects their text;
 * Dragging internal windows [5] is easily broken (apparently in favor of text selection) when quickly moved once.

Note that selecting label text seems reasonable:
 * Simple labels [6];
 * Check box labels [6];
 * Radio button labels [6];
 * etc..

There was a proposed patch [7], within a related mailing list thread [8], which apparently only addressed Opera 9.2x.

Finally, I&#39;m not even sure if this is fixable (within the scope of qooxdoo), nor convinced that this isn&#39;t a bug in Opera itself (which seems not to respect canceling user events), but I believe it is best to start by creating this issue and track it down with more information whenever possible. :-)

            <thetext>Performing a quick search lead to a recent thread [1] where a method which is claimed to work in Opera (no specific version, though) is found within comments.

I&#39;d propose experiments using reduced test cases and later integration with qooxdoo: the idea is to save from the possibility that is the complex event handling of qooxdoo which is preventing the actual trickery from working as expected.

            <thetext>Helder: Thank you for this link. I just tested the linked sample (http://ajaxcookbook.org/examples/selection.html) with Opera 9.5.1 (on OS X) and it is much more difficult to select the text. We will use this solution for now.</thetext>
