            <thetext>I don&#39;t exactly know where to place it so I put it in other category...



I&#39;m building an app with nw.js (previously named node-wekbkit) a webkit engine on top of a node.js program, making HTML page like a desktop app.

On the qooxdoo side, I&#39;m using Qooxdoo server (named qx-oo): http://manual.qooxdoo.org/2.1/pages/server/overview.html


I&#39;m doing &quot;npm install qooxdoo&quot; =&gt; fine
Launching qooxdoo from node instance:

$&gt; node
&gt; var qx = require(&#39;qooxdoo&#39;);

=&gt; fine too


When loading qooxdoo from nw.js so, I got the following error:

node_modules\qooxdoo\qx-oo.js:17 Uncaught ReferenceError: qx is not defined

I guess (just guess) this error has to do with the fact that nw.js use require on HTML side like if it was a client side library.
This is probably the error: behind the scene, it&#39;s still node.js used, yet the window object is defined. And according to qx-oo code, it looks like it matters...

Maybe a workaround for this case would be needed. Actually nw.js define some property you may rely on it to make a special loader case when both node and windows exist at the same time, like:
process._nw_app
window.nwDispatcher


Unfortunately I tried to correct it, without hope, the builder keep giving bad results... And qooxdoo oo is still unusable, which is quite bad :D</thetext>

            <thetext>EDIT:

Just found, in qx-oo (version 4.1) =&gt; http://demo.qooxdoo.org/4.1/framework/qx-oo-4.1.js

Hardcoring it like this:

if(!qx) var qx = window.qx = {};

/** qooxdoo v4.1 | (c) 2013 1&amp;1 Internet AG, http://1und1.de | http://qooxdoo.org/license */


Make the Qooxdoo bootstrap now working. So a workaround like this:

// nw.js bootstrap repair
if(process &amp;&amp; process._nw_app) {
  if(!qx) var qx = window.qx = {};
}

/** qooxdoo v4.1 | (c) 2013 1&amp;1 Internet AG, http://1und1.de | http://qooxdoo.org/license */

At the top of the file should correct the behavior for nw.js without affecting other loader configuration...

Still need more test, but at least now the qooxdoo classes I&#39;ve register are appearing in webkit console as defined...</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report. As the usage of nw.js is (at least for us) an edge case, I don&#39;t think we will put any fix into the framework. But you solution sound like you could prefix the code yourself and get it back to normal in no time.</thetext>

            <thetext>I can understand your point, except the fact it&#39;s not that much an edge case, at least it&#39;s a highly followed/used project now.

And how about other project defining window also, I tried only node webkit but it may have many other projects conflicting because of this...


But after all you decide so ok ;)</thetext>
