            <thetext>The FocusIndicator currently used in the table is rendered as a 2px border around the focused cell. It uses a transparent BoxLayout for that. However, as that is a rectangle (a DIV tag, to be precisely), it actually covers the cell and catches all input events (mouse, keys) etc. That way no &quot;interactive&quot; cell is possible that acts to user actions. A very simple case is a cell containing a link (HTML A tag) which cannot be clicked.

The solution would be organizing four terminators instead around the cell, each rendering the border (or something that appears to the user as a border) of one side of the cell. The FocusIndicator should not use a BoxLayout but a CanvasLayout in that case, with height set to 0 so that it does not cover the cell.

The in place cell editor has to be fixed, too. It is currently being added to the FocusIndicator, but with height=0 the input&#39;s background (a surrounding DIV-tag) is also set to height 0, so that one only sees the input&#39;s text content above the cell&#39;s content (the background is transparent).</thetext>
