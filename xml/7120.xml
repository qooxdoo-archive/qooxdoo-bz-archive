            <thetext>New feature (https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo/pull/40) seems to work different ways in different operating systems. I was able only to check that on Linux, so it works normally there, except when Firefox have to go to the new url by middle button. I am not sure about MacOS and Win7, let&#39;s discuss, how to make it work fine.</thetext>

            <thetext>We are talking about two features.
1. scrolling of tabs
2. closing a tab on middle click

1) The scrolling of tabs did not work for me on windows / osx and also not on any linux app. As this would also be somehow confusing as soon as the overflow handling pops in (I think). So I would rather disagree on adding that as the default behavior.

2) Could see that on windows but not on OSX. As I&#39;m a OSX user, I would never have thought of that feature but I&#39;m open minded and wanted to know others developers opinion on that.</thetext>

            <thetext>It will be good if these features will be included, being disabled by default. This way, developers will have more control over the app. It will be interesting to hear other developers opinion about this feature too.</thetext>
