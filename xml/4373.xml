            <thetext>Using the testrunner for testing the source version of unit tests is really slow, at least if you have a good amount of unit test like in the framework itself. The reason for that is the fact that the browser loads all files needed to test and all tests as a single file which is in total about 400+ files to load. This takes a while!

With the use of a PHP script, we could lead the files in that PHP script, which is on the server and only deliver a single file containing all the source files concatinated by the PHP. That could really speed up the usage of the testrunner during the development of unit test.

Btw. if its working for the testrunner, we could check if its also posible to do that for the playground wich is a bit slow as well in the source version.</thetext>

            <thetext>A first test had some good results. We should wait for a final implementation of bug #4385 to check again if that could be used for the testrunner as well.</thetext>
