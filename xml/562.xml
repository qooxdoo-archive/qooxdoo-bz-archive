            <thetext>Views (discuss the name later) are a mechanism to structurize a complex interfaces into multiple parts.

Only one view can be active in an application. The colors used in this active view by all the inner components are much stronger than the colors used in the other views or areas. For example the active tab may be blue in the active view and white in an inactive view. (=&gt; Eclipse IDE).

These views needs also support for inheritance in the state system e.g. make the &quot;active-view&quot; state available in all children of this view.

Each sub-window (e.g. instance of Window) could also be seen as a separate view.</thetext>

            <thetext>@Thomas, something you could look at? You may want to get Fabian involved as well to account for the latest changes.</thetext>

            <thetext>The last summary for this bug was a misnomer. If you read the bug description, 
you realize that it is about a visual concept (called &quot;views&quot;) that seeks to 
enhance the user interface experience. Particularly, the bug has nothing to do 
with documenting the parts/packages concept of qooxdoo. Additionally, the 
visual appeal of &quot;views&quot; has nothing to do whether parts are used for the given 
application or not.

            <thetext>Yes, right Thomas. My comment #2 was pretty wrong here. It is completely ui related. Moved it to &quot;ui-core&quot; as it basically is a core feature of any modern (complex) ui system.

Maybe it&#39;s interesting to find out how such a mechanism is called under Cocoa for example. Though often in such simple-made GUIs like typical on Mac these stuff is not used (The Finder for example uses the same highlight color independently of the currently selected component). So one might better look at SWT/Eclipse.</thetext>
