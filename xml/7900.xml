            <thetext>With the move to grunt, it would make sense to replace the makefile we have in tool/admin/release with a suitable grunt file which every developer can edit and understand without the need of the make syntax knowledge.</thetext>

            <thetext>A good way to organize that would be that every app / component is responsible for its own build jobs and a top level gruntfile could call the tasks in the fitting application / component folders. So every app could offer a task named &quot;sdk&quot; (&lt;-- tbd) which knows what to do before the sdk is zipped. This could be also true for a publish task so every app could be easily published standalone.</thetext>

            <thetext>We should start with a Gruntfile which does a (Grunt) source/build run for play, mobileshowcase and a skeleton.

This is:
1) a good start for establishing a testing env for the Grunt toolchain in next
2) a needed preparation for publishing the demos online later on

This has to be done anyway because the Makefile in it&#39;s current state (in next) is broken. So instead of adapting it, better do something future-proof.</thetext>

            <thetext>There is now a top level Gruntfile, which has four tasks. 
They are callable like that:

grunt run_grunt:build_play
grunt run_grunt:build_mobileshowcase
grunt run_grunt:build_apps
grunt build_skel

Augment and enhance when time has come.

            <thetext>I am still missing the clean job to get rid of all build artifacts. Additionally, it would be handy to have a job which cleans the whole project of installed npm modules.

And btw. the make files is still present. ;)</thetext>

            <thetext>* removed Makefile
* added &quot;grunt remove_node_modules&quot;
* added &quot;grunt run_grunt:clean_apps&quot;

Thought about migrating make targets regarding the manual too,
but in the future we should use &quot;Read the Docs&quot; exclusively,
i.e. those targets shouldn&#39;t be part of the Gruntfile. 
Will talk about that with Martin.
