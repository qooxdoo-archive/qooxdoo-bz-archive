            <thetext>The generator supports two test jobs, &#39;test&#39; and &#39;test-source&#39;. The difference is that in the latter case the AUT (application under test) is generated in the source version. The output is therefore a test/script/tests.js and a test/script/tests-source.js. Consequently, there are two html pages to load the different test apps. The testrunner frame application is the same in both cases.

When starting the testrunner application, it tries to load the tests.html AUT page by default. The corresponding tests.js might not be generated at all, so it will not finish loading, and you have to manually edit the AUT url in the testrunner to point to the tests-source.html AUT page. This is rather unintuitive, and there might be a better way of doing it.</thetext>

            <thetext>This is especially annoying because of bug #1488, which require me to &quot;hard reload&quot; the whole page (the test runner itself too) and consequently, re-change the AUT url every time. Quite a pain...

As for a solution to the problem, you could either provide two different &quot;index.html&quot; with a different default value for the variable holding the AUT url. Alternatively, you could use a parameter in the URL for the AUT url. Not sure how hard that&#39;d be.

Btw: I much prefer to use &quot;test-source&quot; than &quot;test&quot; so that when something fails I have a vaguely understandable traceback. And I guess people test more often the &quot;source&quot; version of their app simply because they test more during development than during production. Shouldn&#39;t &quot;test-source&quot; be the default here (ie renamed to &quot;test&quot;), and &quot;test&quot;, renamed to &quot;test-build&quot;?</thetext>

            <thetext>Fixed with the addition of test/index-source.html. If you generate test, you 
open test/index.html, if you generate test-source, you open 
test/index-source.html. The test runner GUI is the same in both cases, but the 
latter will instruct the runner to load the source version of the AUT.</thetext>
