            <thetext>It would be nice to have this implemented in qooxdoo: http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-2.0-alpha1/examples/message-box/msg-box.html,
all kind of message boxes and notifiers.  I think this should be very easy to implement by using qooxdoo.</thetext>

The main problem for having something like this is how to achieve the same semantics of Javascript&#39;s native alert() and confirm(); is there a way to block inside JS??

Otherwise we&#39;ll be facing a hell of parameters. 

On the other hand, the quality of visual aspects will be (hopefully) achieved with 0.8.

We could have several variants, one of the could have the same parameters as confirm and alert.
To block inside JS can be achieved already with modal dialogs.

I&#39;m impatient for this moment to arrive! Surely the new release will be so innovative as the latest ones.  :-)</thetext>
