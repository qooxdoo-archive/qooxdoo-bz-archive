            <thetext>Just a thought on generator documentation:  I&#39;ve always thought that a graphic view of how the source and build jobs operate would be most helpful, demonstrating the &quot;combining&quot; of configuration files into the final job result.

I&#39;m sure that someone with an intimate knowledge of the build system could chunk out something representative on a napkin during a short break (or maybe not - we all need breaks).

Anyway, some type of tree or flow diagram that shows how a source job starts, processes, and finishes would go a long way to explaining how it all fits together.  I would love to have a better understanding of the process, and this would explain more than multiple screens of text ever could.  If a picture is worth a thousand words (still true?), it applies here as much as anywhere.</thetext>
