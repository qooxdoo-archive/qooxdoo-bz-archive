            <thetext>The result output in the middle pain remains across test runs (within the same 
session, i.e. without reloading anything).  This makes it hard to follow the 
current run and its results.

E.g. when you select and run the &quot;dev&quot; tests, then select and run the &quot;core&quot; 
tests, the results of the core tests will be added on top of the dev results. 
You have to search the boundary between the first test run and the second with 
the eye, which is tedious. 

Now if you run the &quot;dev&quot; tests again, their result will be updated *in place*, 
which is only indicated by the flashing green background (and only if you 
happen to look at that part of the output at this moment). No other indication 
is given that you have to scroll down to review the updated test results of 
&quot;dev&quot;. The &quot;core&quot; results remain in the list ahead of the &quot;dev&quot; results.

Especially when you hit &quot;Stop&quot; in the middle of re-running a test package, you 
have no indication which tests have been updated and which haven&#39;t.</thetext>

            <thetext>Added a &quot;Clear results on run&quot; option to the GUI. Default is true, which should be the expected behavior for most users.

Fixed with b429ae0c3363d97630bc8b8c9b18831bd444bfc0 (master)</thetext>
