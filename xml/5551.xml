            <thetext>qx.ui.form.ComboBox has buggy behavior when it contains are multiple ListItems that have the same value in their model. When selecting any element (except the first) that have the same model, the ComboBox selects the first one.

For an example of this behavior, see the bug URL (try to change the selection in the ComboBox)</thetext>

            <thetext>This is documented behavior and due to the model selection stuff necessary:
http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/#qx.ui.form.MModelProperty~model

Could you maybe explain your use case where you needed that? Maybe we have to search for another solution if we have some valid use cases where not unique models make sense.</thetext>

Even if this is indirectly documented, the behavior is wrong. The user expects that exactly the selected item to be active, not something else. 

The bug was discovered when using the ComboBox for a URl selection. Each entry has a title (which is displayed), and a URL (the model property). Some items have different titles, but the same URL. When the user selects one of them, the ComboBox selects a completely different item, which is plain wrong.</thetext>

Well, if the components get used in a way they are not intended and documented, the outcome will be wrong, thats true but expected.
But your use case convinced me that we should have another look at the designed behavior and if possible, change that. Thats why I marked the bug as enhancement and changed the title. But don&#39;t expect too much of it, it might be an necessary implementation detail that the models are unique in that case. As a workaround, just attach a hash to the url which makes them unique again.</thetext>

That is exactly what we did, as a temporary workaround.</thetext>
