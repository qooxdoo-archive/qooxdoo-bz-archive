            <thetext>We have the possibility to add some HTML code to our index files which will be shown as soon as the index file has been loaded and as long as the qooxdoo app has started (the app will override the body anyway). So we could use these facts and add some loading mechanism to our apps, especially the feed reader to showcase how that could be done with minimal effort.

We could also check all other apps which might benefit from that like the testrunner or playground wich might take some time to load.</thetext>

            <thetext>Added the already used loading images in the feedreader and playground to as loading indicator to the index.html files.
