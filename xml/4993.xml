            <thetext>The following tasks have to be done for this bug:

* Analyse Startup of a qooxdoo application
   * profile: where is most of performance lost / hotspots
   * file-size: unnecessary dependencies
* Create Tasks</thetext>

            <thetext>Tested qx.ui.core.Widget vs qx.ui.mobile.core.Widget vs.  qx.ui.core.Widget (without Content Element / Decorator Element) vs. qx.ui.core.Widget (without Content Element / Decorator Element / without qx.html.Element)

Short results
* qx.ui.mobile.core.Widget is clearly the fastest (5-25x faster, depending on tests and device)
* Startup time mostly depends on the size of the script (e.g 300 kb = 5sec , 600 kb 10sec on Wildfire)
* qx.ui.core.Widget: When we would like to improve speed of class, the best scenario was just to remove the content / decorator / shadow element and to keep the qx.html.Element. qooxdoo layouting will be fasted in this scenario. Styling can be still made by qx.theme, but we would have to allow direct styling of css in the appearance. This might be considered for tablets (when RIA widgets are still too slow). Still, the full RIA widgets weren&#39;t much slower (7s vs 6sec for 1000 widgets on HTC Desire).

Full test results on demand.</thetext>

            <thetext>Marked as fixed, as performance gap between both Widgets systems on slow devices is too large. So there is no need to remove dependencies from RIA widgets, so that they can work on slow devices right now. Still, removing dep. from the mobile widgets (like qx.bom.*) would result in faster startup. Other suggestions would be to use the new environment optimization.</thetext>
