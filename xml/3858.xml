            <thetext>Now we have 3 applications that uses some kind of Log window: Playground, DemoBrowser and TestRunner. We should abstract this into a common Log window, that can be used by all apps.

Thomas: We could start this as a contrib, in &#39;components&#39;, or just as a name space within an app like Playground. Other apps like Testrunner could use it from there. I&#39;m very much in favour of adding component libraries to our standard apps, to get our fingers dirty with this kind of things as our users are facing the same issues.</thetext>

            <thetext>I&#39;d prefer to have that in the framework&#39;s component/, maybe some kind of common/ library folder. What do you think?</thetext>
