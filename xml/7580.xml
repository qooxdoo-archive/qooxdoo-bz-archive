&quot;I had to add ‘if (element.setCapture) element.releaseCapture();’ to the mouseup function to avoid some odd behaviour in IE9, namely being unable to move the browser once setCapture had kicked in despite releasing the mouse button on or off the browser.&quot;</thetext>

            <thetext>From the blog post: 


Sure, opening either of the demos above shows the behaviour – I’ve just checked again now using IE9. In both cases you can see the behaviour by clicking and moving the orange rectangle and then trying to move the browser window by clicking on the top bar and dragging it – this leads to the orange block moving rather than the window. The second demo isn’t so bad in that clicking outside the window returns things to normal. In the first it seems as though the only way to get back to ‘normal’ is right clicking somewhere. As I say, I think that both can be solved with the ‘if (element.setCapture) element.releaseCapture();’ line (meaning perhaps it isn’t a bug but an ‘improvement’ in IE9? – I don’t know).</thetext>
