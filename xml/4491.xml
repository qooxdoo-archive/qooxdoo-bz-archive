            <thetext>Building the Showcase (either source or build) exits with the error message:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Verifying Parts...
  - Verifying: htmleditor
Load-dep loaded after using class (&#39;qx.ui.menu.RadioButton&#39;[2,292]):  
&#39;qx.ui.form.IBooleanForm&#39;[3,312]

The issue seems to be triggered by recent changes to qx.ui.form.TextArea, 
working on bug#4324 (13dec10). Setting back this class to a revision &lt; 24334 
fixes it.</thetext>

            <thetext>Looking at the verbose generator output revealed that the package with 
qx.ui.menu.RadioButton (#3 -&gt; #515 -&gt; #899) was always sorted *before* the 
package containing qx.ui.form.IBooleanForm (#387). Although the dependency 
between the two packages was managed correctly, and #387 was introduced to new 
parts correctly, the *sorting* of the packages within the parts went wrong, as 
the sorting only relied on the part count of each package (#899: 5, #387: 4).

I solved this by adding a .part_mask attribute to the Package class. This is 
updated during merging to reflect the parts the package is currently used in, 
and thus is changed when #387 is used in more and more parts than initially, 
due to its dependents being merged in larger packages. .part_mask is also used 
in .part_count, which in turn is used in package sorting, so these changes 
propagate to the sorting routine. - It felt awkward to use the Package.id for 
this which reflects the initial part bit mask. I left it as the package&#39;s 
identifier, with the changed semantics that it is the initial part bit mask and 
*before* any part collapsing.

I took the opportunity to switch to a more elaborate compare function for 
package comparison during sort, which emphasizes dependency relations between 
packages, and only uses .part_count as a fall back for independent packages; 
this seems to work fine for Showcase and Feedreader, and the mail client app up 
to part verification.
