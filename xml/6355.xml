            <thetext>I have noticed that many times, both in the manual and the blog reports, the word &quot;when&quot; is used instead of &quot;if&quot;. This is obviously the result of a mistranslation of the German word wenn, which is used for both. 

Examples:
[1] http://news.qooxdoo.org/qooxdoo-re-shaped &lt;- The first sentence should either be &quot;If you are reading this, ...&quot; or &quot;By the time you are reading this...&quot; etc..

[2] http://manual.qooxdoo.org/devel/pages/mobile/tutorial.html &lt;- &quot;The usage of the form classes should be familiar to you when you have used the RIA widget set.&quot;, Should be something like &quot;The usage of the form classes should be familiar to you IF you have used the RIA widget set BEFORE/PREVIOUSLY.&quot;

I can&#39;t locate yet further examples, but I thought simply to raise attention to the matter.

Thanks for the great work!

            <thetext>Hi Omri, good point, thanks for raising this. [2] is truely a mistake. In the case of [1] the intented meaning is in fact temporal, but I agree that &quot;By the time you are reading this...&quot; is indeed the better formulation.</thetext>

            <thetext>Fixed [2] (I think [1] is good enough).

            <thetext>Hi Omri, thanks for your input. Lets keep fixing all those language glitches, no matter how minor - they distract, at least. 

I&#39;d like to encourage you (and everybody else) to consider to use pull requests on Github. That&#39;d be convenient for proposing even a larger number of documentation fixes. The qooxdoo Manual is under
https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo/tree/master/documentation/manual/source/pages</thetext>
