            <thetext>When searching for Spinner, you should get the result:
qx.ui.form.Spinner
and the properties where spinner is in the name of the property.
in general, one should get results when searching in the name of an item, not in the fullname.
in this case:
qx.ui.form.Spinner#editable
or
qx.ui.form.Spinner~maximum

shouldn&#39;t be among results, as spinner is not found in the name of the properties:
editable and maximum.
However,
qx.ui.control.ColorSelector#hsb-spinner-composite should be shown as spinner is in the name of the property.</thetext>

            <thetext>in the apiindex.json file, there is a duplicate entry.
i take the example of menu property in the qx.ui.form.MenuButton class.
go here: http://demo.qooxdoo.org/devel/apiviewer and search for menu, with only properties toggle on, and menubutton in the namespace as filter.

you will see 4 entries, with 2 identical:
qx.ui.form.MenuButton#menu
[this info can be used to solve bug #5063]
this is happening because we have in apiindex.json file these 2 entries in the __index__ key:
&quot;#qx.ui.form.MenuButton#menu&quot;:[[5,339]],
and
&quot;#menu&quot;:[[6,339],[6,359],[6,387]],
where 339 is the index of qx.ui.form.MenuButton in __fullNames__ value, and 5 is entry in __types__ [6 is property in __type__].

in order to solve this bug [that is, when searching for button, the qx.ui.form.MenuButton#menu should not appear] we must remove the &quot;#qx.ui.form.MenuButton#menu&quot;:[[5,339]], entry and add [5,339] to the other one:

&quot;#menu&quot;:[[6,339],[6,359],[6,387],[5,339]],
this will solve also http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5063 because we removed the duplicate.

also, I still can&#39;t figure out why menu is a property and an entry at the same time, but maybe there is a good reason for it which escapes me.

Martin, I guess you could redirect it to Daniel to solve it at generation time.</thetext>

            <thetext>I chose &quot;entry&quot; as the type for the &quot;apply&quot; node&#39;s children because it&#39;s the most generic type we have. I didn&#39;t want to use &quot;property&quot; since the value of those is the name of a property on the current class, while an &quot;apply&quot; child&#39;s value is the fully qualified name of a property that might be defined on an ancestor  class.
What I didn&#39;t realize was that the type of any node with a &quot;name&quot; or &quot;fullName&quot; attribute will be added to the __types__ index, which is how the &quot;entry&quot; type slipped in there. This also leads to the bogus &quot;#class#property&quot; entries. 

So I simply changed the attribute name from &quot;name&quot; to &quot;applies&quot; and modified the APIViewer&#39;s MethodPanel to use that instead.

Fixed with r27102 (trunk) and r27103 (branch_1_4_x).</thetext>
