            <thetext>Leaving the playground application currently dont aks if the user really wants to leave the site. In case you changed something in the code, the changes will be lost on a site change or reload. So perhaps i is a good idea that if the user has changed the default demos, the applications asks the user if he really wants to leave.

Perhaps, the user could be asked to save the current code or the application could offer him a link which he can use the recover his code some time later.</thetext>

            <thetext>In Opera (all versions under Windows and Linux) the warning dialog is displayed every time the user selects a new sample, even if the current sample&#39;s code wasn&#39;t modified.</thetext>

            <thetext>We had that kind of behavior implemented before, but it wasn&#39;t very convincing. Do you think it&#39;s the best solution, or would it need some additional features (like a &quot;don&#39;t display warning&quot; checkbox)?

Anyway, this bug report is about a defect in Opera, so if it is trivial to fix you should do it for the time being.</thetext>
