            <thetext>You can add more than two widgets to the split pane, the pane cares only about children of index 2 and 3 but the layout determines the widget in index 2 as first widget and the absolute last added widget as second. This causes in a problem: 
e.g. The pane will care about widget 2 and 3 but the layout is rendering 2 and 4 (if added three widgets)

as can be seen here http://tinyurl.com/psq4opw


I would expect the pane has always two widgets, a call of add() causes in a rotation of widgets from right to left respectively bottom to top.

Further more I would love to be able to set widgets on a given position first (left/top) and second (right/bottom)

We can use protected _addAt() method but an public one would be helpfull especially because the offset for widgets is 2 (child control splitter and slider are previously added)

            <thetext>From my point of view this bug can be split up into two.

1. Make sure the &quot;add&quot; method is causing a exception in debug mode whenever more than two widgets are added.

2. Provide a API to easily add a widget at a defined position, e.g. removing the left widget and adding a new widget at this left position with one API call.


I guess this would be easier to understand and it won&#39;t be necessary to add some magic concerning the rotating of the widgets.</thetext>
