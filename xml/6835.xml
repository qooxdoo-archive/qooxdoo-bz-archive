            <thetext>Double quotes can appear in msgid&#39;s and msgstr&#39;s, but sometimes they are 
escaped (\&quot;) and sometimes not. This leads to msgid&#39;s beeing treated as 
different id&#39;s.

E.g. the generator might extract a msgid like

msgid &quot;push the &quot;foo&quot; button&quot;

but a translator after editing the .po file might return the same entry as 

msgid &quot;pubsh the \&quot;foo\&quot; button&quot;

            <thetext>I&#39;ve upgraded polib to 1.0.1. This version now enforces escaped double quotes 
in values. From our old patches to polib, I only had to re-apply  the one 
removing handling of arbitrary escape sequences. (The other issue, adding 
self.obsolete to POEntry.merge, is gone; see bug#1846).

TODO: It could be that the generator has to do extra work when extracting 
message id&#39;s from source code, to ensure double quotes are escaped.

&gt; ... I only had to re-apply  the one  removing handling of arbitrary escape 
sequences.

Concerning this patch I&#39;ve created an issue with pull request at the Polib 
tracker:

            <thetext>I&#39;m closing this as fixed. The new polib version enforces escaped double 
quotes, so there shouldn&#39;t be any more room for ambiguities. The generator 
properly escapes double quotes for msgid strings found in source code if 
necessary, and when writing translation mappings to package data. Also, the 
lookup of msgid keys with unescaped double-quotes in the source works during 
runtime (as both the key in the source code as well as in the package data are 
normalized by the JS interpreter).

As I haven&#39;t changed anything regarding the escape handling in the generator 
(outside of polib), I&#39;m still not clear how the unescaped double-quote made it 
into the .po file. Must have been a hand-edit.</thetext>
