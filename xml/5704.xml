            <thetext>When passing the JsonToTree demo to the playground the editor will report &quot;Nested comment. Stopping, unable to continue. (26% scanned).&quot; on line 23. The problem is the wildcard in the #asset since it is in a commented block:

#asset(qx/icon/${qx.icontheme}/16/mimetypes/*)</thetext>

            <thetext>Thats interesting and true. Thats what the spec says about nested comments

7.4 Comments
Comments can be either single or multi-line. Multi-line comments cannot nest.

So it is a lucky coincidence that this is working in the browsers.</thetext>

            <thetext>The main thing is that you don&#39;t use the comment terminating sequence &#39;*/&#39; within a comment. So an embedded comment start sequence is permissible and usually accepted: /* ... /* ... */,
but not:  /* ... */ ... */

(Crockford&#39;s JsLint is overly picky here).

But the issue remains that wildcard expressions in #asset hints (and #ignore hints, btw) may run into the hard issue of a comment terminating sequence:

#asset(qx/icon/${qx.icontheme}/*/mimetypes)

A probably good solution would be using a wildcard character other than &quot;*&quot; for the same purpose. This would eliminate all those problems and avoid any ambiquity with comment chars. &quot;?&quot; or &quot;~&quot; would be good candidates, as both are not legal JS identifier chars (and &quot;?&quot; being known from shell globs). Although resource id&#39;s could in principle contain those characters, I would consider that bad practice (JS identifiers are enforced for class paths, and the resource paths should follow suite).</thetext>
