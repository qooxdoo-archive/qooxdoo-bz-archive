            <thetext>Procedure to reproduce (should be very easy):

Create a SelectBox with enough items to make the scrolling bar appear. Then click on the scrolling bar with the mouse, keep the button pressed and move the mouse outside the webpage. An exception is thrown (actually, a lot of them).

This is reproducable under FF and Safari. We have a system in place that automatically reports JS exceptions happening in our application so this periodically comes up, a fix would be much appreciated.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report. Just checked it and its not reproducable in the playground due to the fact that the playground uses native scrollbars. Building a skeleton which ueses the qooxdoo scrollbars shows the following error in Widget.js:105:

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method &#39;isVisible&#39; of null

Should be an easy one and could be included in 1.2.2.</thetext>

            <thetext>That was an easy one, just added the missing check for the existence of the target and thats it.

            <thetext>Yeah, I thought of simply doing that. But did you check there are no side effects at all? (eg, selection is always valid, stuff like that).</thetext>

            <thetext>Should not have any side effects due to the fact that if no target is available, there was always an error. Additionally our night test will show if there is something wrong. :)</thetext>
