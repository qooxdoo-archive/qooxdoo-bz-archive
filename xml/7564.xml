            <thetext>Creating a server on Win8 works only occasionally. Most of the time, the first load works as expected but using it for some time, the server stops and does not restart or either stops with a corresponding error message.</thetext>

            <thetext>The culprit is IE (IE9 and IE10, in varying degrees). All works fine in other 
browsers (FF, Chr, Opr). IE is clogging up the Python web server. It stalls on 
a data connection, when downloading a file (e.g. one of the script files of the 
app), thereby also stalling the simple web server. Killing IE will resolve the 
sitatuation, bringing the web server back to functioning. Some SO commenter 
speaks about content length and response chunking [1].

I would need to dig deeper into that to find the actual cause, prob. using a 
packet sniffer like Wireshark or CharlesProxy. Other &quot;small&quot; web servers have 
the same problem (I&#39;ve tested with newLisp, node.js would be another 
candidate). As this is going to far for the release, postpone this until after.

The work-around is to use some &quot;major&quot; web server that supposedly handle HTTP 
traffic more subtlely. I tested with nginx for Windows which works fine. Using 
this to serve the app also the reload-server works with IE.

            <thetext>Re. other &quot;small&quot; servers:

Node.js-base &#39;node-static&#39; server seems to cope fine with IE10 when using 
manual refresh of the app in the browser (i.e. the app refreshes reasonably 
fast). Using the reload-server is still wanky (The client pull requests are 
sent, but the server never &quot;signals&quot; a new version to the browser).</thetext>
