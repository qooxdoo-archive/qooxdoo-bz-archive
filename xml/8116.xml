            <thetext>As soon as we added a polyfill for pointer events, we should make it possible to use those pointer events in the event layer for qx.Desktop / qx.Mobile. This most likely includes a new event type and a special handler for those events. Additionally, we have to extend desktop and mobile widget to support these events as well.</thetext>

            <thetext>Here is a list of events we should support in the first place and some hints what needs to be considered:

pointerdown
-----------
mouse: use mousedown event
But the mousedown event is fired for every new button pressed on the mouse. The pointerdown event should only be fired if any button is pressed and NOT if a second or third button is pressed.

touch: use touchstart
The touchstart is fired as soon as any finger touches the screen. For additional fingers, a touchmove will be fired. In the case of pointerdown, a new event should be fired for every finger on the screen.

pointerup
--------
mouse: use mouseup event
As with mousedown, the pointerup should only fire if no button is pressed anymore.

touch: use touchend
See pointerdown for that. pointerup should fired for every finger leaving the screen.

pointerover
----------
mouse: use mouseover
touch: needs to be fired before a pointerdown event

pointerout
---------
mouse: use mouseout
touch: needs to be fired after a pointerup event or a pointercancel event

pointermove
-----------
mouse: use mousemove
This event also needs to fire if the a button stat has changed. 

touch: use touchmove
There need to be separate pointermove events for every finger on the screen.

pointercancel
-----------
mouse: not needed
touch: use touchcancel</thetext>

            <thetext>pointer* events are now* supported across browsers/devices, as are gesture events for &quot;tap&quot;, &quot;longtap&quot; and &quot;swipe&quot;. Still to do: &quot;dbltap&quot;.
