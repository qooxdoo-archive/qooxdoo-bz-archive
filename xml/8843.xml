            <thetext>Once the qooxdoo-contrib GitHub organization is designated to be the successor
of the former repos (under the qooxdoo GitHub organization) and websites
(http://qooxdoo.org/contrib/catalog):

* change the &quot;CONTRIB_CATALOG_BASEURL&quot; macro in the &quot;base.json&quot; pointing now to
the catalog hosted by the qooxdoo-contrib GitHub organization
* take down http://qooxdoo.org/contrib/catalog and redirect to catalog hosted
by GitHub

            <thetext>The GitHub qooxdoo-contrib repos have the following state:


* contrib entry page now hosted by GitHub [1] 
  Repo: qooxdoo-contrib/qooxdoo-contrib.github.io
* contrib catalog now hosted by GitHub [2] 
  Repo: qooxdoo-contrib/catalog 
  Branch: gh-pages

[1] http://qooxdoo-contrib.github.io/
[2] http://qooxdoo-contrib.github.io/catalog/ 

Next Steps should be:

  a) point http://qooxdoo.org/contrib/catalog/ to the GitHub hosted catalog [2]
  b) remove the old static web site (hosted by us)
  c) document (manual &amp; README in repo) the updating of the (new) contrib catalog
  d) remove checksum within the Manifest files for the master downloads within the Generator (this is the most annoying part of the new contrib landscape)
  e) change the &quot;CONTRIB_CATALOG_BASEURL&quot; macro in the &quot;base.json&quot; pointing now to
the catalog hosted by the qooxdoo-contrib GitHub organization
  f) announce that the catalog can now be community driven developed</thetext>

            <thetext>Most of the mentioned tasks (a-f) are done:

 - Removed ContribLoader.py. This makes our interface to the contrib landscape much leaner and more maintainable. No automatic downloads and no checksum checks anymore.
 - Adapted [1] and [2].
 - Adapted contrib pages in our Wiki.
 - Adapted manual pages regarding contrib topic.
 - Added Wiki &quot;How To&quot;-pages to the contrib catalog [3] (as jump start for the community).
 - Moved code from the platform repo inside the catalog repo. In order to update the catalog entries and/or it&#39;s website you now only need this very repo.
 - Created the (GitHub) team &quot;Contributors&quot; within the qooxdoo-contrib organization. People belonging to that team can edit the catalog repo (and update the website).

master: 5ff0f5986cdb2a219cc35127568b9f52c2d1fd2d

ToDo after review:
  a) redirect http://qooxdoo.org/contrib/ to the GitHub hosted orga page [1].
  b) redirect http://qooxdoo.org/contrib/catalog/ to the GitHub hosted catalog [2].
  c) remove the old static web site (hosted by us).
  d) remove contrib-catalog and contrib-platform repo under qooxdoo user (GitHub) - make forks within qooxdoo-contrib orga (GitHub) to new origins.
  d) announce that the catalog can now be community driven developed.

            <thetext>Add&#39;tl idea: let qooxdoo-contribs be put into the npm catalog. 

jQuery just recently &quot;forced&quot; their plugin authors to move to npm, which came as quite a surprise to the npm people: http://blog.npmjs.org/post/111385956875/welcome-jquery-developers

In the meantime a post is available on how-to transform the manifest into a package.json:
