My workaround is to use a hbox layout and add the child controls manually.</thetext>

            <thetext>I checked the behavior of the center property and have to say, it was not obvious how it behaves when turned off according to the docs. The case described in the code sample shows a button which is as wide as its content but the height has been increased by increasing the labels height. Now disabling the center property centers the content on the x axis which had the same result du to the already mentioned fitting width. If you would like to have the icon on the top position, you could have simply set the icon-position property to &quot;top-left&quot; and that works as expected.
So I think that this is not an issue with the code, rather with the docs which did not specify how the property reacts when turned off. Extended the docs for master:
