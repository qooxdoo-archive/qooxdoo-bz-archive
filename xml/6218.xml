            <thetext>In certain cases it is helpful to let the generator name the package with the same name as in the configuration mentioned.

Can you please add support for this?</thetext>

            <thetext>You are confusing parts and packages. Parts have names (from the config). But each part is embodied by multiple packages (these are generated as files). On the other hand, packages are shared between parts. So how could you name a package after a part?!</thetext>

            <thetext>Ok, then would be it possible to name a part like the config and if the part has multiple packages add a hash to it.

So e.g. part name is &quot;base&quot; and the package names would be:

* base.js (first package)
* base.7jfdsl38jfldsjfldsf.js (second package)

This is how it works now except that only the name of the first part is always used as package name.</thetext>

No. As I wrote, packages are *shared* among parts. So your &quot;base.*.js&quot; packages are most like used by other parts as well. They are *not* specific to the &quot;base&quot; part.

You probably have the idea that the packages which are created on disk can be separated by the parts they are used in. But this is not true. Just take a look at a generated loader of an app that uses parts (e.g. Feedreader).</thetext>

            <thetext>Not generally possible - consider using separate build jobs.</thetext>
