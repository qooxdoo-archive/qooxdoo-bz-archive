            <thetext>Before staring i want  to be clear,I don&#39;t know what or how my request could be answered.

In a class file, if a code line ends with a dot instead of a ;
Then the line after will be simply concatenated  with the following. Even with a blank line in between.

I understand that this behavior of the compiler is nice if we use a chaining style.
But could we print a warning message.

I made this request because i just have an issue with this.
The compilation pass without problem. And then when running the code i hade an &quot; unexpected token &quot; exception in the browser console.

And with chrome there is way to show more details.
But Firefox help with a chunk of code around the instruction that cause this exception.

My case was someting like this:

code().code().

new qx.code.code()</thetext>

            <thetext>Hello Benjamin,
I understand your request and also understand that its hard to track if something like this happens. Especially when its such a slight difference in the code some barely recognizes. Still, it could be valid JavaScript code and even that we don&#39;t recommend the chaining style for desktop-style apps, we should not warn about something which is valid. We don&#39;t want to force people to use our way of coding which means in the end, we need to make it possible to write in other coding styles as well.
I&#39;ll assign Thomas to get his feedback in as well  but I don&#39;t think that we will do much about that.
Regard,
Martin</thetext>

            <bug_when>2012-11-27 14:04:02 +0100</bug_when>
            <thetext>Since it&#39;s not a recommended style in desktop app.
Maybe it could be a warning only for this kind of app.
With an optional flag in the config file to switch of thoses warning?

Would this be a viable solution ? I&#39;m just throwing idea, maybe there is a better way.
Or as Martin says there is no solution since it&#39;s a valid js line</thetext>

            <thetext>It&#39;s a valid bug, actually a good one, and not a question of style.

o You can break JS expressions freely across multiple lines (Even the Generator sometimes takes advantage of that).

o But the expression

  something.something.
  new something

  is a syntax error, as &#39;new&#39; is taken as an attribute on some intermediate object, and object attributes cannot be followed by another identifier.

The Generator should detect this when compiling the source.

(Node example:
  function foo(){
      this.foo = foo;
      return this;
  }

  foo().foo().
  new foo()
)</thetext>

            <thetext>To summarize we won&#39;t make it illegal to write 
xxx.xx.
xxx

But the expression could be illegal
xxx.xxx.
new xxx

This could be an enhancement for the compiler.

Today i went into another exemple of expression i think illegal

xxx.[xxx].xx()

Is the .[] part of this expression is legal in js??
This exemple compile without error.</thetext>

I totally agree on that.

No, thats as far as I know, also not legal. Could be a good idea to detect that too.</thetext>
