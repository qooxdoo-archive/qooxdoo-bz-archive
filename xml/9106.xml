            <thetext>+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #8939 +++

Same behaviour as for the checkboxes and radiobuttons applies for textfields which are added to a form with a corresponding description. they should also retain their size and fore the text to break to the next line.


Current Behavior:
When they are not having enough horizontal space, they get shrink horizontally (see screenshot).

Expected Behavior:
They should retain their size and break to the next line (next already does that).</thetext>

            <thetext>If you want to, you can file a pull request. This speeds up the whole process a lot. :)</thetext>

            <thetext>Tobias, you mention a screenshot, but there isn&#39;t one attached. Also, do you have a playground sample similar to the one in bug #8939 that demonstrates the issue (because shouldn&#39;t textfields be flexible per se)? In any case, if you had a bugfix (e.g. pull request), that would be best.</thetext>
