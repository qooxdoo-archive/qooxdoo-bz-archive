            <thetext>Internal class attributes are always displayed. Icon (red square) and 
background (light red) are like private attributes, but this is independent of 
the &quot;Private&quot; toggle button. For the time being, internal attributes should be 
toggled with the privates ones.

Example is qx.core.Environment#useCheck.

This is a regression from 1.3.</thetext>

            <thetext>this one relates to the hack that i did for http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3181. the hack was added in order to allow accessing he url:
http://demo.qooxdoo.org/devel/apiviewer/#qx.core.Environment~useCheck directly.
these internal methods that we take as private ones in the api viewer must be handled by a new toggle, independently of the &quot;private&quot; one [see the last 2 comments on 3181 bug]. I could extend the hack and make the icon and the background color like the public ones, as useCheck doesnot have __ prefix.</thetext>

Martin said that much, but for the time being we need a short-term solution.

No. Can&#39;t you treat them like privates, as it was before?! Privates can also be linked, and when such a link is activated, the &quot;Privates&quot; button is set to on. The same could happen to internals, so they go away when &quot;Privates&quot; is toggled off.</thetext>
