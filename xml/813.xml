            <thetext>Steps To Reproduce:

var c1 = new qx.ui.form.ComboBox;
var item;

item = new qx.ui.form.ListItem(&quot;&quot;);
c1.add(item);
item = new qx.ui.form.ListItem(&quot;Item No 1&quot;);
c1.add(item);
item = new qx.ui.form.ListItem(&quot;Item No 2&quot;);
c1.add(item);

The first (empty) entry height is much smaller than the others.</thetext>

I&#39;m sorry, but a combo box that is not able to display an empty item in its drop down list is unacceptable. There is no use in an item that consists only of a few pixels padding. Users don&#39;t notice it and can hardly click on it. Such an item looks &quot;broken&quot;. Please equip the combo box with a look and feel that resembles other widget toolkits.

I think that applying a static height is not an option, as the height should dynamically adapt to the font size and all items should always have the same height in a text-only list.

            <thetext>Whining do not help any much. Solutions are welcome though. Maybe it would be a 
good idea to generally measure the size of the label, when not content is 
given, as if a least one character is in. This would be relatively easy to 
modify and should fix this issue as well. What do you think?</thetext>

            <thetext>Ok, maybe this is not that easy, because the ListItems used by the SelectBox 
are basically atoms and atoms do not render the label instance at all, when no

            <thetext>Would it work for you to just define a single space character instead of an 
empty string e.g.

qx.ui.form.ListItem(&quot;&quot;) =&gt; qx.ui.form.ListItem(&quot; &quot;)

This renders with a correct height in my tests.</thetext>

I also tried this but the item looked the same as with the empty string in 0.7.3. Also tried &quot;&amp;nbsp;&quot;, which rendered ok in the drop-down list, but due to bug 1033, the string &quot;&amp;nbsp&quot; is displayed in the text field when selecting this item.

However, the suggested workaround involves another problem: selecting an empty item should not result in any whitespace in the text field, but in an empty text field. I think there&#39;s nothing wrong with internally filling the item in the drop-down list with white space but when selecting, the text field must be empty. Maybe an &quot;empty&quot; flag might help.

            <thetext>This is nothing I want to change for 0.7.x - this is currently in process to 
get modified for 0.8 exclusively.

In 0.8 there is a difference. A SelectBox could work easily with the &quot; &quot; string 
because the user can not edit this one and it is not visible to him.

A ComboBox might still be a problem because of the TextField. Mhh. So, if the 
user create a ListItem with an white space, it makes sense that this is 
reflected in the textfield. The issue however might be that the user want an 
empty item (not an with a white space) and a empty item should be empty in the 
text field as well.

As mentioned before the current handling in an Atom is that when the text is 
empty or null the label instance is not created. Maybe we should rethought this 
and modify it in a way that it threats null and &quot;&quot; differently. Where null 
means, that no label is created and the size of the label is completely 
ignored, &quot;&quot; means that the Label is respected for sizing and the label instance 
is created. This would also solve the auto-sizing issue. Any opinions?</thetext>

Absolutely ok for us. But I can&#39;t test it with 0.8 yet.

&gt; is created. This would also solve the auto-sizing issue. Any opinions?

To differentiate between null and the empty string as proposed sounds reasonable to me.</thetext>
