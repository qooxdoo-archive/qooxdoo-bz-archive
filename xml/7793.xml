            <thetext>The &#39;clean&#39; and &#39;distclean&#39; jobs are defined independently, in base.json and 
elsewhere. This usually leads to config duplication and inconsistencies, as 
&#39;distclean&#39; is usually taken to be a super-set of clean actions. E.g. it 
includes all local clean actions and also clears the global cache.

Hence it would be more consistent and easier to maintain if &#39;distclean&#39; 
inherited from &#39;clean&#39;, and just adds additional clean actions. I&#39;ve already 
did this for libs that had their own clean jobs defined, like component/server 
and component/website. Both are also interesting as their config definitions 
are propagated to their corresponding skeletons, &#39;server&#39; and &#39;website&#39;.</thetext>
