            <thetext>Currently, the browser window can be resized to a very small window, but 
standard apps like Apiviewer, Testrunner, etc. do not react on this at all. As 
a result, the app&#39;s content and controls get simply outside the browser window 
and the user has no chance of interacting with them. Scrollbars do not show up, 
to make the obscurred parts reachable again.

As this affects nearly all of our standard apps, and maybe user apps as well, 
it would be good to have a general strategy how to address this issue.</thetext>
