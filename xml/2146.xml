            <thetext>The reordering is broken. At least in Firefox 3. It seems to start correctly, but the sequence is not stoppable correctly afterwards.

Example on the right: application/demobrowser/source/index.html#ui~DragDrop.html</thetext>

            <thetext>I could only verify that it doesn&#39;t always work reliably in FF3/Windows. Not sure, Sebastian, what you mean by &quot;sequence is not stoppable&quot;?

@Alex, please also have a look.</thetext>

            <thetext>The sequence of drag&amp;drop was never stopped e.g. the cursor was still the old one and the reaction on the dragging never stopped - even after mouseup on the button.

Somehow this seems to be fixed now as it is not reproducable for me in Firefox and Safari anymore. Maybe this was a temporary issue in trunk only.</thetext>

            <thetext>At my linux machine everything is working fine in FF3.

@Andreas
What do you mean with: &quot;it does not work reliably on FF3/Windows&quot;?</thetext>

            <thetext>I noticed at least the following: While dragging it is possible to place the mouse pointer exactly over the 1px drop indicator. This leads a non-droppable cursor and the drop is ignored (as expected?). 

It would probably be best to enhance the example code in such a way, that the drop is handled correctly even when targeting the indicator.

            <thetext>@Andreas: Though that has nothing to do with the original issue why this bug was reported. I would suggest to close this bug as INVALID or WORKSFORME for the moment as it is not reproducable anymore.</thetext>

            <thetext>Alex and I found out about the issue with the indicator, so we added an appropriate description. It&#39;s ok to fix this issue within the existing bug report, I expect it to be resolved soon and the bug then to be closed.
