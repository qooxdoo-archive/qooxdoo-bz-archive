            <thetext>A new sandbox attribute was introduced. Seems like IE10 / Safari / Chrome Dev are already supporting it.

http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#attr-iframe-sandbox

Environment Check:
&quot;sandbox&quot; in document.createElement(&quot;iframe&quot;)

Description (Taken from above W3C Spec):
&quot;The sandbox attribute, when specified, enables a set of extra restrictions on any content hosted by the iframe. Its value must be an unordered set of unique space-separated tokens that are ASCII case-insensitive. The allowed values are allow-forms, allow-same-origin, allow-scripts, and allow-top-navigation. When the attribute is set, the content is treated as being from a unique origin, forms and scripts are disabled, links are prevented from targeting other browsing contexts, and plugins are disabled. The allow-same-origin keyword allows the content to be treated as being from the same origin instead of forcing it into a unique origin, the allow-top-navigation keyword allows the content to navigate its top-level browsing context, and the allow-forms and allow-scripts keywords re-enable forms and scripts respectively (though scripts are still prevented from creating popups).&quot;</thetext>
