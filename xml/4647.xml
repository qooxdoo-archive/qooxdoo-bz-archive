            <thetext>We have the following situation in the appearance:

We have defined a button having some complex calculations concerning a special property, lets say, the padding. If we want to include the buttons appearance in another appearance and want to add a bit more padding, we need to do the whole calculation again because we don&#39;t have access to the value of the included appearance.

So including that already calculated styles would be easy and would minimize the copy &amp; paste code in the appearance theme.</thetext>

            <thetext>Added the fix with r25029 some time ago and its working as expected. Already used it in the recent changes of the modern theme. Nevertheless, added some details to the manual as well (r25160).</thetext>
