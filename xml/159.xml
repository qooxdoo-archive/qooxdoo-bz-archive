            <thetext>The API viewer should:

* Remove properties and replace them with their setters and getters in the function list
* Hide all private/protected fields and methods (not make them optional) (They are only interesting for the developer)</thetext>

            <thetext>In my opinion this shouldn&#39;t be changed at all.

The properties are more than their getters and setters. So I would like to have them listed in some way. We could add an extra check box that shows the getters and setters in the method list, but we should not remove the properties list.

Also the protected methods should stay. Yes, they are a feature for developers. But I am a developer and I want this feature.

If your intention is not to show too much information to newbies, which finally leads to traffic on the mailing list, then add a build option to the api generator, which is off by default. But removing this information is not the way to go IMHO.</thetext>

            <thetext>I would suggest to only hide private members and leave the rest as it is now.</thetext>

            <thetext>private members/statics (starting with &quot;__&quot;) are now hidden from the API viewer. Everything else keeps the same.</thetext>
