            <thetext>Consider the following situation:
A developer wants to create a base lib to include this lib at e.g. 20 different web pages. At these web pages there are several different native applications used (one per page).

If the generator is able to create the applications dependent on the base lib classes (and its dependencies) we would end up with applications that only contain the application code + framework classes which are not already inlcuded in the base lib.
This way the base lib can be deployed for each web page and the application can be added easily with very small footprint.

So all we need is to be able to build an application dependent on a (computed) exclude list which is gathered by the building of the base lib.</thetext>
