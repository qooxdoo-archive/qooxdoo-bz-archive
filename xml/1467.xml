            <thetext>Thomas, please evaluate if this is something to be targeted for 0.8.2 or only a  later release. If there&#39;s a quick fix possible, it would be very helpful not to spoil beginner&#39;s first impressions.</thetext>

            <thetext>Hey, while I understand that this is not really a fatal bug, it makes the &quot;./generate.py pretty&quot; job completely useless for me, since it messes up my nicely decorated and commented code. It is really so difficult to repair this?</thetext>

            <thetext>I don&#39;t think that its that difficult to repair it. But as always, we are running out of resources and I am quite sure we can&#39;t get that done for the upcoming release. Assigning the bug to 1.3.1 only means, that we plan to fix it for the next release which is better than having it on unassigned. That means, we don&#39;t know when we want to fix it. :)</thetext>

            <thetext>Fixed in trunk with r27307.

The issue needed to be addressed in the parser. When a multiline comment is 
encountered during parsing, leading white space up to the start of the comment 
are already processed, so are not known to the comment token itself. But then 
the rest of the comment is included in the token, including all the indentation 
of the subsequent lines. When the comment is then re-inserted during 
pretty-printing, *all lines* are equally indented. The first line thus gets to 
the correct position, but all subsequent lines are indented *additionally* to 
the white space they already contain. This lead to this double-indentation of 
comment lines beyond the first.

The fix was to normalize leading white space during parsing. The column 
position of the first line is known when the comment is encountered, and that 
much spaces are stripped from subsequent lines (if they have at least that much 
leading white space). This seems to work well for stand-alone multiline 
comments.

It will not work when tabs are used as leading white space (But tabs are 
deprecated as indentation anyway).

It will not work as expected if a multiline comment starts at the end of a 
normal code line, and the subsequent lines are alined with the comment. E.g.

var a = 3; /* this var
                      is used throught
                      the rest of this file
                   */

will give you

var a = 3;  /* this var
   is used throught
   the rest of this file
 */

under pretty printing. The &quot;relative offset&quot; of the subsequent lines to the 
comment start is retained, but not the absolute.</thetext>

            <thetext>I&#39;ve talked to Martin, and  we&#39;re re-targeting this bug to 1.5. The fix was 
done in the parser of the generator which might have far-reaching consequences. 
So, due to the bug severity being minor, but the fix being major, I wouldn&#39;t 
want to put this strain on the maintenance branch.
