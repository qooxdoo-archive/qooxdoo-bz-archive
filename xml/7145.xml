            <thetext>Applications based on qx.Desktop do currently have some obvious disadvantages when used on touch devices like tables. But its a valid use case to do so. As the whole desktop GUI layer only reacts on mouse events, thats only possible because the mobile browsers fire mouse events as well. But they delay the events by a short amount of time which make the applications feel slow and unresponsive.
We could simply disable the listening to the native mouse events and therefore convert the touch events to mouse events.</thetext>

            <thetext>Merged in my changes into master with e31a8d68495fe0e02f53986f39e443c0b205c456.

This is a first implementation and can be turned on by the environment named &#39;qx.emulatemouse&#39;
I will do some more tests and see how its working out.</thetext>

            <thetext>Hi Martin

I&#39;ve given qx.emulatemouse a try on an iPad with iOs 6.1 and have found some issues:

1. Menu bar buttons qx.ui.menu.Button remain in visual focused mode after first tap and do noch change back to unfocused if the focus moves away.

2. Lists (qx.ui.form.List) as in the combobox and tables (qx.ui.table.Table): swipe allways leads to a selection, activating the item where the swipe started. I think this should only happen on tap.

3. It would be great to have some translation of the contextmenu event (long press tap?) and the doubleclick event (double tap?!?!?)

Besides this issues taps and swipes feel more responsive, bringing desktop apps near to usabillity. Thank your for that.

Regards
Dietrich</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the feedback. I will check what I can do about these issues. We still want to test it with one of our own apps and see what else might be wrong.

            <thetext>Some more Feedback:

I had to disable qx.emulatemous due to problems with IE10 on Windows 7:

1. Toolbar menu buttons did not open the corresponding menu on left click (but did open on right click). The left click did trigger the &quot;activated&quot; state but did not open the menu. Toolbar buttons (without associated menus) did react an left click.

2. As soon as a table gets focus the view scrolls with the mouse movement as if there was a swipe on touch devices which stops after the table looses the focus. This is without holding left or right mouse button down.</thetext>

            <thetext>Using a menu button seems to be suboptimal. As soon as you touch the button, the menu opens. If you move your finger a bit on the button, a scroll event is fired and the menu will be closed. Thats really unexpected behavior.</thetext>
