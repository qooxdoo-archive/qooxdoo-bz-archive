            <thetext>There may be a dependency problem in the 0.8.3 GA release.

It seems that qx.dev.Stacktrace was called by Logger to report a deprecation 
warning when loading a custom theme. At least in the source version.

The problem is that the custom themes are loaded before qx.dev.Stacktrace, so 
if you have an error in the theme, it does not get reported correctly.

I bumped into this because my custom theme was not migrated from 0.8.2 to 0.8.3 
and Qooxdoo was attempting to show a deprecated warning.

I fixed my theme, but perhaps the logging should be inplace/loaded before 
attempting to load user defined classes, because we users are so good a 
breaking things.

Here is the top of my &quot;uris&quot; array from  in the &quot;source&quot; version

  uris : [[&quot;qx:qx/Bootstrap.js&quot;,

&quot;qx:qx/util/Json.js&quot;,
....

As you can see myApp.ui.theme classes are loaded before qx.dev.StackTrace.

Not sure if this is a generator dependency issue or a coding issue on the 
logger.

I am still in the middle of the migration, so I have run tried a &quot;build&quot; 
version.</thetext>

            <thetext>Mike,
could you re-test this bug?! Fabian did some refac on framework dependencies 
(bug#2426), mabye that solved it.
Thanks</thetext>

            <thetext>I think the situation is still valid in current trunk, I&#39;ve looked at a stock 
gui skeleton&#39;s list of included classes.

I talked with Martin, and we might consider making a special setup for the 
&#39;source&#39; job in the config (base.json), which uses &quot;require&quot; to force certain 
classes early up in the include list. E.g. adding &quot;require&quot; : { &quot;qx.Class&quot; : 
[&quot;qx.log.Logger&quot;, &quot;qx.dev.StackTrace&quot;]} might be enough to have qooxdoo&#39;s 
reporting infrastructure readily available before any of the application 
classes are loaded.</thetext>

            <thetext>I have not retested - I am still on 0.8.3 - I will get the latest trunk and 
attempt to recreate. This will have to wait a day or two until I have some free 
time.</thetext>

            <thetext>Worked around the problem by

- adding #require(qx.dev.StackTrace) to qx.log.Logger

This forces StackTrace to be available when Logger is, so calls to Logger 
methods can run successfully.

- swapping the order of ${APPLICATION_MAIN_CLASS} and ${QXTHEME} in base.json

This results in the theme classes being loaded later. (This actually doesn&#39;t 
contribute to the work-around, but seems like a sensible thing anyway).

            <thetext>It might be possible to find a more general solution to the current problem. 
I&#39;m closing this bug, but created a follow-up bug (bug#3589) that addresses 
this. If a more general solution is found, the essential change done for this 
bug (#require(qx.dev.StackTrace) in qx.log.Logger) may be reverted.</thetext>
