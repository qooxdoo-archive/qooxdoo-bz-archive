            <thetext>Currently, the qooxdoo version sting is hard-coded in the manual in many 
places, e.g. in version-specific links to demos on the demo.qooxdoo.org site. 
Doing a global search-and-replace over all .rst files for every release to 
patch in the correct version string is tedious and error prone (Last time, this 
process corrupted a manual page of the tooling section, which used numbers that 
were unrelated to the qooxdoo version).

It would be best if the manual source code could refer to the current qooxdoo 
version with some kind of macro, which is centrally maintained, so that all 
occurrences get automatically updated with each version change.</thetext>

            <thetext>This appears not be doable with reST tools. All my attempts failed, also 
suggestions gathered from the Sphinx Google group. E.g. I tried reST 
substiutions and the &#39;replace&#39; directive, and Sphinx document hooks. None of 
these possibilities was e.g. capabable of inserting a version string into a 
hyperlink, which is a crucial use case for us.</thetext>

            <thetext>I implemented a simple, source-level macro facility for our manual, using 
string.Template and the Sphinx extension API. The extension is implemented 
directly in the project&#39;s conf.py of our manual. (It could be placed in its own 
file, but is so tiny it hardly deserves it).

With r23850.</thetext>
