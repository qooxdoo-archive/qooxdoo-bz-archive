            <thetext>I&#39;m using Firefox 3.1 beta 2 on Mac OS X.

(I&#39;m not sure if this is a Firefox or a qooxdoo bug - either way I guess you&#39;d want to know about it).

Using http://demo.qooxdoo.org/0.7.4/showcase/#Tree, the first child element of a sub-tree is displayed incorrectly when the sub-tree is expanded. Closing and re-expanding the sub-tree fixes .
Specifically, the text of the element is displayed at the right height, but hard against the left of the tree area. The icon and expander are either not displayed or occluded - they&#39;re invisible in any case, even with short labels.

I&#39;ve observed this in the showcase, and also in an Eclipse RAP application (latest RAP CVS, including qooxdoo 0.7.4).

I have also observed intermittently tree controls in a RAP application not displaying at all, although reloading the view fixes this.

The trees in the 0.8 showcase don&#39;t appear to be affected by this.</thetext>

            <thetext>I see similar, but not as severe glitches on Firefox 3.1 beta 2 on Windows.
It appears the first child element of the first sub-tree opened is sometimes aligned incorrectly - everything else works fine, and closing/reopening the tree doesn&#39;t fix the layout.</thetext>

            <thetext>Tim, thanks for keeping an eye on this issue that you brought to general attention in the first place. 

Great to see the issue seems to be resolved in a newer beta release of FF. I&#39;ll close this bug as INVALID, since the intermediate beta versions of FF shouldn&#39;t really be relevant to typical users.</thetext>

&gt; 3.5 beta 4 appears to have fixed this.
&gt; All of the linked tree examples, and trees in Eclipse RAP appear to work fine.

My guess is that this could be a duplicate of bug 1664 (marked invalid as it was due to a bug in Firefox which was recently fixed). If one wants to make sure of that, using the beta 2 and disabling JIT in about:config would cause the issue not to reproduce -- more instructions in bug 1664. Naturally, that would be just for the record, as marking as a duplicate would also cause this to be an invalid issue. :-)

So, if anyone is curious enough and has a bit of spare time... ;-)</thetext>
