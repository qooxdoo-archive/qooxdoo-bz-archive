            <thetext>Unloading qooxdoo application (by closing browser, reloading the page or navigating to another page) trigger unnecessarily GET request to the server. The reason for this is setting the source of an image (to empty string) in Preloader.js#destruct
....
this._element.src = &quot;&quot;;
....
Is this really needed? Two lines bellow the _element is disposed anyway.</thetext>

            <thetext>See bug 809. The complete explanation of why that line is needed is in that issue. It would seem that if the line wasn&#39;t there that the image element would remain in memory even when the application was unloaded.

A hint: you can use SVN Blame to find out when any lines in a file were changed. Very helpfully, Fabian put a complete log message in for that line:

fjakobs  01/07/2008 19:33:28           
[BUG NEW 809]: Image preloader doesn&#39;t abort download properly 
http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=809

So I could very quickly find the bug that related to the line (it was one of mine, which is why I knew to look for it!).

Just shows the value of meaningful SVN log messages rather than just &quot;minor fix&quot;.

            <thetext>Given bug #809 we may have to set this to wontfix? Ivan, is this a real problem, or could you workaround that? If you come up with a solution, it may be included into the snippets section of the online docs?</thetext>

            <thetext>For RAP this was a major issue. Our fix is comment this line that set the image source in Preloader.js#destruct.
