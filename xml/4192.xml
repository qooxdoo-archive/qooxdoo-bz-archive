            <thetext>The following happens:

1. when the first pane is added -&gt; changeSelection is fired
2. when concomitant panes are added -&gt; NO changeSelection is fired

this is not logical, because if you have something dependent on the changeSelection it gives different result from time to time for example different number of children (panes) and in the current case always 1 which is wrong when the widget appears. Use case here has not been modelled very well!

We propose that changeSelection is fired only the first time the widget appears.

            <thetext>Hello Stefan,
this behavior is due to the selection model of the stack. It has, like a radio group, the selection mode &quot;one&quot;which requires one element to be selected all the time. The first time your create your stack, it has no page added which means, in the sense of the selection, an invalid state. As soon as you add a page, the stack tries to get rid of that invalid state and selects the page you added. This is also the page which will be shown no matter how much pages you add after that. When you add the second page or any other page, the selection is fine and don&#39;t need to update because it has already selected something.

So it is logical but maybe not in the sense you have seen it. The behavior is totally expected which is fine for me. Connecting the changeSelection event to the appear state of a widget is not a good idea in my opinion.
Best,
Martin</thetext>

            <thetext>I agree with you when it comes to connecting two events, but forking by creating a third one might solve it. Ok, you have made your decision.</thetext>
