            <thetext>Open the &quot;Showcase&quot; application and select the &quot;Localization&quot; tab.

If the internal window is dragged around it &quot;jumps&quot; a kind of when the mouse button is released. This issue seems to be only applicable for the &quot;Showcase&quot; application.</thetext>

            <thetext>The issue was first reported through the mailing list [1], so some follow up may occur there too (although naturally it would be preferable here).

Regarding the bug, it&#39;s relevant to state that this occurs only in the Localization section (with that specific internal window) and apparently not with other internal windows (at least, not within the &quot;Showcase&quot; application).

When the window move operation finishes, the weird offset seen suggests a match the application padding values. I&#39;m not sure if this relation can be assumes, but intuitively/visually it makes sense. Didn&#39;t analyze the code for sure.

Trying to move the troublesome window many times sometimes causes only an offset in the left or bottom direction (typically it will occur in both directions causing a diagonal offset). This tricky/hard to reproduce situation suggests some weird timing interaction or some more complex underlying bug.

Finally, just checked that this affects all releases since 0.7 (bug report properties updated).

Hope this helps,

 Helder Magalhães
