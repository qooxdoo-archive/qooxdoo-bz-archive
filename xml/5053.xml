            <thetext>In the api viewer, there&#39;s currently no way to hide members that were included from a mixin.

It would be nice to be able to toggle display of included members. This could work the same as how inherited members can currently be toggled.</thetext>

            <thetext>Great to see that this feature has been added. :)

However, personally I don&#39;t like the pulldown menu that much, because the menu 
button does not give any visual feedback about the current state (contrary to 
the toggle buttons).

A possible improvement I can think of would be to change the icon of the 
includes-menu, based on which options have been selected.</thetext>

            <thetext>Gabriel, could you take care of that. Different icons could really improve the usability here.</thetext>

            <thetext>i can see the point. i agree. maybe i will choose a totally different widget, as i cannot see what to do now when both the inherited and mixins are selected. what should the menu button show to the user?</thetext>

            <thetext>I think the most obvious choice would be to have the menu button show the same icons as that are currently shown in front of the inherited/included methods in the API viewer.

In case both options have been checked, the menu button could show a combined icon with both the &quot;up&quot; arrow (inherited) and the &quot;top-right&quot; arrow (included). But this might get cumbersome if you would ever want to add more options to the menu.

What&#39;s the reason that you moved the items into a menu instead of adding a new toggle button for mixin members?</thetext>

            <thetext>Adding to my previous comment:

I ment a combination of the images:
- method_public_inherited18.gif
- overlay_mixin18.gif

            <thetext>the reason was that the number of toggle buttons was too great, and i wanted these filters to occupy the right end of the toolbar, not all of it. plus, inherited and mixins filters have similar meaning - something external of the class is inserted into the doc viewer.</thetext>
