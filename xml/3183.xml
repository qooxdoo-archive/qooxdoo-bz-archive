            <thetext>The new version of the demobrowser looks very clean, but has lost much of its useful functionality. Even with my many years of qooxdoo development, I still look to the many demos in the demobrowser for examples of how to do things. Furthermore, when I&#39;m answering questions for people on the mailing list, I will point them to the appropriate demobrowser demo as an example of how to do what they&#39;re asking. Today I tried to do that and found the relevant demo gone; I had to point them to the &quot;current&quot; rather than &quot;devel&quot; tree, and that tree will disappear entirely with the next release.

I appreciate the clean-up of the demobrowser, but please put back all of the previous demos, possibly under a closed-by-default &quot;advanced&quot; tree branch.

            <thetext>Derrell, those demos have not been removed, they are just hidden after startup in the current trunk version of the demobrowser, which features a filtering by name or tag. I asked Martin already to relax the filtering at startup, which currently isn&#39;t prominent enough.

            <thetext>I removed the startup filter (r 20973) to make all demos visible again. With the decision of building a separate showcase app, we can now use the demobrowse more as an development tool again.</thetext>
