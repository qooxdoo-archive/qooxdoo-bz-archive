            <thetext>Hi Martin, the situation is that a object controller throws an error when binding a new model after the old one was disposed. As the result of that the new model is never set!

1. A button is bound to model &quot;A&quot; by a qx.data.controller.Object.
2. Dispose Model A
3. Set model B as the new model for the controller.

This is the public gist link if you want to see it live on the qooxdoo playground
https://gist.github.com/862508
or
git clone git://gist.github.com/862508.git gist-862508

Thanks in advance,
Erol Demircan</thetext>

            <thetext>Info: 
error occurs on Line 133 of qx.data.controller.Object and is thrown from qx.data.SingleValueBinding-removeBindingFromObject line 1081.

Work around is to catch the error on line 133 but it is not solving the problem because the changed id still remains in the this.__bindings[targetHash].

Good luck.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report. As a workaround, I would suggest to &quot;remove&quot; the model before disposing it while removing means setting the model to null.</thetext>

            <thetext>Added a simple check for disposed models to make that work.
