            <thetext>This is a follow-up on bug#4441.

The current config API and implementation of the &#39;config-warnings&#39; key, to 
suppress well-known configuration warnings, is preliminary and marked 
&#39;experimental&#39; in the manual. Finalize it. This probably means that the API and 
the implementation have to be re-thought.

- it is open which sub-keys are best for the config-warnings key (fixed keys 
like &#39;job-shadowing&#39; which refer to a single warning; &#39;config-includes&#39; which 
refers to an entire sub-action of the config system; variable keys like job 
keys that can be repeated literally in the config-warnings key; ...)

- it is unclear which values are best for those sub-keys: lists (as it is now), 
boolean, ... should mixed types be allowed?

- the current implement is ad-hoc; config-warning settings are queried just 
before the corresponding console.warn() call; as these console.warn() calls are 
distributed over the entire generator (at least generator.py, Generator.py and 
generator.config.*), so are the queries; more code like this will increasingly 
blur the actual effect code in the generator (the code that acutally *does* 
something); but there is no concept to e.g. delegate config-warnings settings 
to general log routines or something

- the top-level &#39;config-warnings&#39; might itself become a sub-key of a more 
general &#39;defaults&#39; top-level key

- i think the current way of integrating the top-level key with a single job 
(like with the global &#39;let&#39;) is ok

Of course answers also depend on usage experiences, feedback and future 
requirements.</thetext>

            <thetext>One insight from working on bug#4615 is that it&#39;s probably best if warnings 
related to code are configured with some lint options for the 
lint/source/build/... jobs, or as @hints in the code itself. The 
config-warnings key could then be restricted to warnings that affect the config 
system alone (job definitions, job shadowing, include files, ...), which seems 
like a much better separation of concerns.</thetext>

            <thetext>I think the best way is to separate purely config-related issues and issues 
having to do with JS code, as indicated in the previous comment. Code-related 
warnings should have their own dedicated tools to deal with. The remainder of 
the config-warnings key should be focussed on config issues only. This part 
(i.e. the affected config-warnings subkeys) could probably be left as is and 
this bug be closed, until concrete requirements show up to modify it in a 
certain way.</thetext>
