            <thetext>Make line ending style for &#39;fix&#39; job configurable. Currently, everything is 
forced to LF.

Add support for:
- LF
- CR
- CRLF

(These are the possible values for the svn:eol-style property).</thetext>

            <thetext>Yes, but why aren&#39;t all files&#39; svn:eol-style properties set to &quot;native&quot; so that it gets checked out correctly in each developer&#39;s environment, regardless of the environment that particular developer is using?

(This may not be the appropriate place for it, but I&#39;ll re-open the bug just so this doesn&#39;t get lost.)

            <thetext>This is actually independent of svn:eol-style. The &#39;fix&#39; job treats files on 
disk, whether these are svn-controlled or not. If they are svn-controlled, you 
can give them any line ending you like, and it will not affect the format they 
are checked out by your colleague (so running &#39;fix&#39; is effectively useless for 
that).

The fix job is rather for files as you want them outside svn. We use it before 
we package up the SDK (and these files are obviously not svn controlled, once 
they are in the sdk). If people want to use it for their project files, I think 
it&#39;s  only legitimate to allow them to define their preferred eol style (and 
this requirement came up on the ML).

I just wroten an email today regarding svn:eol-style=native, arguing it&#39;s not 
worth the effort making it a hard requirement for the framework, as most 
(decent) tools simply handle any line ending just fine, so you won&#39;t even 
notice if the file your are processing (with browser, python, editor, ...) has 
one line ending or another. If you nevertheless feel strongly about 
svn:eol-style as a framework requirement, open a dedicated bug for it.</thetext>
