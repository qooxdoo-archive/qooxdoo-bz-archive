            <thetext>I&#39;d say this issue isn&#39;t receiving as much attention as it should because Christian didn&#39;t link the original thread [1] here.

Could you do that, Christian? It made much more sense if it was you doing that, after the request from Chris.

Thanks, although given the fact that you created this bug 01/2010 ... :).

&gt; or is this the kind of comment one should not post as Nabble tells me (&quot;Avoid
&gt; small talk such as &#39;Thank you&#39;, &#39;Great&#39;...&quot;)

I&#39;m not sure. Maybe if you engage in a technical discussion it would be helpful to focus on technical posts that add to the subject. But even then I don&#39;t see why a reasonable poster shouldn&#39;t express appreciation (or even dislike) once in a while. I think we here at the core team are quite interested in feedback :).</thetext>
