            <thetext>Since Firefox 3 the usage of locally executed javascript (with &quot;file://&quot; protocol) is more limited regarding loading files.

If a file is loaded it has to be at the same level of the file which loads the javascript. In order to keep local development of the HtmlArea going the &quot;blank.html&quot; was moved to the same level.

On the other hand it can be a little confusing when running a webserver and integration the HtmlArea into an application to use this &quot;blank.html&quot; instead of the file provided by the qooxdoo resources.

Add a dispatcher to check for which protocol is used and only load the local &quot;blank.html&quot; if the HtmlArea is used locally.</thetext>

            <thetext>I did some expiriments and looked the way TinyMCE works.

Browsers i tried: [FireFox3.6, Opera10, Chrome4, IE8]

* blank.html - obviously works in any of them
* about:blank - works but Chrome
* javascript:&quot;&quot; - works but Chorme

The later way is used by TinyMCE&#39;s iframe and it works in Chrome as well. It could be a solution to, if figured out the reason it doesn&#39;t work in Chrome now.</thetext>

Thanks for the research and the infos.

&gt; now.
I&#39;ll take a look at this issue as soon as I can. I really need something like a 36 hours day :)

Anyway, your infos look good and if there aren&#39;t any issues with &quot;javascript:&#39;&#39;&quot; when running under SSL in IE it might be a solution. The reason why Chrome is not working should be solvable, I think.</thetext>
