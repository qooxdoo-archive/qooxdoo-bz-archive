            <thetext>In showcase (http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/showcase/#InternalWindow) click on &quot;Open modal dialog 1&quot;.  The modal (internal) window will open.  Now click on a different tab, e.g. Themes.  Note that the modal (internal) window is displayed over the new tab&#39;s canvas.

One of two things should (instead) have happened:

1. The fact that it&#39;s a modal window should have prevented selecting a different tab

or

2. Modal internal windows are deemed to be tab (canvas) specific, so the modal window should have disappeared when selecting a different tab and then reappear when returning to the tab on which it was created.

It would be great if the user could select the &quot;scope&quot; of modality: either current canvas or global, in order to select between the above two options.  In no case I can think of, however, would one expect the current behavior to be appropriate.

            <thetext>I could not switch any tabs when opening the modal window. Normally, when a modal window is open, the whole application is blocked. This was also the case when testing here under Windows Vista/Firefox 2</thetext>

            <thetext>Confirmed.  The problem I was seeing previously no longer occurs.
