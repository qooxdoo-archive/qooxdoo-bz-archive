            <thetext>The &quot;selectable&quot; property on qx.ui.core.Widget is to determine whether the user can select the text on the widget or not. However it&#39;s not functional. Nothing will happen if set the property.

This bug can be very easily reproduced in Playground by creating a label with selectable property set. You cannot select the text on the label.

Have to mark the bug as Major to bring attention because it blocks my application. Really want it to be fixed ASAP. Thanks a lot.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report Wayne. As we are currently in the release pahse and after the code freeze, we will not include the fix of this into the next release (1.2). But i marked the bug for the 1.2.1 release and will take care of it ASAP after the release.</thetext>

            <thetext>The selection is getting interesting cross-browser. Here is a summary on four major browsers. To verify, open the Playground in the browser, and add two labels with selectable on onto the doc. Seems we need to fix both IE and FF.

IE8 (IE8 mode) -
  Mouse selection : &quot;selectable&quot; works properly.
  Ctrl-A all text selection : 
    *Click on the Playground code area and press Ctrl-A, all code text is selected, which is expected. 
    *Click on any of the labels on the result panel and press Ctrl-A, all text except the code is selected, which is totally wrong. 
    *Click on the background of the result panel and press Ctrl-A, all code text is selected, which is wrong.

FF 3.6 - 
  Neither mouse selection nor Ctrl-A all text selection works.

Google Chrome 5 -
  Mouse selection : &quot;selectable&quot; works properly.
  Ctrl-A all text selection : All three test cases, on code area, on label, on background, work properly.

Safari 5 - 
  Works same as in Chrome</thetext>

            <thetext>Hello Wayne,
I just checked your results. It seems to me that you have missed the warning in firefox:

qx.ui.basic.Label[40]: Only rich labels are selectable in browsers with Gecko engine!

Setting the label to rich will bring up the desired behavior. Thats a side effect of taking XUL labels for non rich content in Firefox (and having text overflow). So I moved the bug down in its prio because this is by design.

Here are my test results:

OS  | Browser | version | Mouse Selection | cmd + A selection
--------------------------------------------------------------
OSX | Chrome  | dev     |      WORKS      |    WORKS
    | Firefox | 3.6.8   |      WORKS      |    WORKS
    | Webkit  | -       |      WORKS      |    WORKS
    | Safari  | 5.0.1   |      WORKS      |    WORKS
    | Opera   | 10.52   |      WORKS      |  selects all
--------------------------------------------------------------
XP  | IE      | 8       |      WORKS      |  selects all
    | Firefox | 3.6.8   |      WORKS      |    WORKS
    | Safari  | 5.0     |      WORKS      |    WORKS
    | Opera   | 10.60   |      WORKS      |  selects all
    | Chrome  | 5       |      WORKS      |    WORKS

As you can see, selecting all on a page is a problem in operan and IE. I will check if we can fix this.
Best,
Martin</thetext>

            <thetext>After some research I have to close that bug as wontfix because there seems to be no way to fix this. There eis a CSS attribute in Firefox and Webkit for disabling the text selection which also takes care of the cmd+A selection. This attribute is missing for IE and Opera which leads to this behavior. Looks like we have to wait for a cross browser CSS 3 implementations of &quot;user-select&quot;...
