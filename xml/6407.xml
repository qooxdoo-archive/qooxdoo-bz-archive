            <thetext>Comparing the playground app between versions 1.6 and 2.0pre, it strikes me that the log window is much better in 1.6: it is better readable, because the font is darker, and the font is also smaller so more log text fits into it. I wish to urge you to revert to the old style of the log window.</thetext>

            <thetext>The font in the 2.0pre playground is adapted to the font size of the whole theme. I think we should not switch it back to the old theme because it would simply not fit the general new look of the app which has a bit more space and bigger fonts.
In the end, its a matter of taste...</thetext>

&gt; In the end, its a matter of taste...

Sure, in the end everything is a matter of taste ;-) But: Contrary to what its name suggests, the Playground is a tool, and not a toy. And when used to conduct tests that log to the console, form should follow function, not the other way round. And the new form, according to my opinion at least, is clearly less readable than the old. 

But you decide, of course.</thetext>

So what do you suggest to be changed. Maybe we can find a look which fits the new design but is still more readable.</thetext>

            <thetext>The log is loosing its relevance more and more with all modern browsers have good consoles and everybody should know how to use them. So I think thats good enough how it is at the moment...</thetext>
