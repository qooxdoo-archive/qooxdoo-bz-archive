            <thetext>Hi,

This &quot;bug&quot; (I wouldn&#39;t qualify it as that tough) follows your post about qx.Desktop on mobile devices.
I didn&#39;t know in which category I had to post so I selected the widgetbrowser.

I tested the qx.desktop widgetbrowser on my iPad and what I found a bit annoying is that sometimes the edit focus on editable fields (textfield, textarea, combobox...) was tricky because it was interpreted as touchmove. 

Finally, the focus was set but I had to touch the field again to edit it. 
Of course, I could have used the &quot;next&quot; and &quot;prev&quot; buttons of the virtual keyboard but sometimes it&#39;s simply not possible.

Besides, when the edit mode was set, I wasn&#39;t able to make a selection of the text inside the field.

Maybe this should be treated as special case in your event layer (just a suggestion of course) ?

Best,

Benoît.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report. Do you talk about every editable field or only about the table?</thetext>

            <thetext>From Benoît Collignon via email: &quot;I&#39;m talking about every editable field (actually, I didn&#39;t event tried the table widget), only the basic form components.

But I&#39;ll try to edit cells to see if the experience is similar this evening.&quot;</thetext>

            <thetext>Sorry for the email to &quot;bugzilla-daemon@qooxdoo.org&quot;. I tough there was some sort of cronjob to handle answers thanks to the title of the email.

Indeed I tried to edit the table widget but the zoom is triggered unfortunately.
I think there is a special meta tag to disable the zoom but I&#39;m not sure if it can work in all cases.

Best,

Benoît.</thetext>
