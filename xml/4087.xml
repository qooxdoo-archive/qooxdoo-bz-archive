            <thetext>Vertical translation
--------------------
Qooxdoo does not support vertical translation directly, but can easily be achieved. Example of a vertical translation is a list of countries where you want each country name to be translated in its own language, not all in one language.

Sverige
Schweden
England
√çsland
Norge

Solution: You would need to go through all the available languages, look-up the
key you&#39;re interested in (e.g. &quot;word&quot;), and accumulate all possible
translations in a custom data structure.

&lt;maybe someone can write a short example code here&gt;</thetext>

            <thetext>Isn&#39;t that the thing i just wrote in the tutorial? It should contain that and is already in the manual (not online yet). Or do you talk about something else?</thetext>

            <thetext>No it is not the same as is written in the text, but your decision is possible to apply for both.

My suggestion:

in the manual:

_____________________________
Vertical translation
--------------------
At the moment vertical localization translation is not supported by Qooxdoo. (reference link to solution page&gt;
_____________________________

then on the newly crreated solution site, add the full text with the link, if any, to the playground code.</thetext>

            <bug_when>2010-09-17 10:04:05 +0200</bug_when>
            <thetext>Why should you do that?

Developers coming from all over try to find solutions on this and even though Qooxdoo does not directly support it, it can easily be implemented. Help developers write better and faster code!</thetext>

            <thetext>Stefan, could you share pointers to other frameworks that support exactly such
a &quot;vertical translation&quot;, thanks. It doesn&#39;t seem to be a commonly
requested or available feature elsewhere? Assigning to you to provide more
input.

Suggesting a practical solution for your example: since the country names are given in their country-specific naming, they are independent of the locale of the app, right? Could you therefore just use fixed, non-translated strings?

You said &quot;it can easily be implemented&quot;. Not sure about that, but if you come up with a solution, we should make sure it would be available to others (e.g. bug resolution, user snippets or contribution).</thetext>
