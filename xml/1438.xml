            <thetext>Summary/Todos:
Preparing the framework (JS code and build process packaging) for creating apps that run in AIR&#39;s:
1. non-application sandbox
2. application sandbox


From recent posts to the mailing list:

Back in July 2007 qooxdoo was one of the first adopters of Adobe AIR, way
before its 1.0 was finally released (Feb 2008??). But API progress and
security changes require some significant changes to the original code.

Still, it can be done: qooxdoo&#39;s build process is able to do all the
processing and packaging that is required for a deployable AIR app. While
the security restrictions are more difficult to cope with, Adobe did a
smart job there, accounting for some alternative scenarios, so it&#39;s even
possible to run a regular, unmodified qooxdoo app as an AIR app.

An unmodified qooxdoo can&#39;t be used for creating apps that run in the application sandbox (e.g. due to
the lazy evaluations of dynamic properties after application startup). A
non-application sandbox is fine (as explained above), and as Adobe is providing a &quot;bridge&quot;, AIR
API could selectively be exposed to the qooxdoo app. This is a potential
security issue, though, which needs careful inspection and fool-proof
wrappers.</thetext>
