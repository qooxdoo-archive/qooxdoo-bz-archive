            <thetext>Use the following code to reproduce:

      tree = new qx.ui.tree.VirtualTree(null, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;children&quot;);
      this.getRoot().add(tree);

      var model = {name: &quot;root&quot;, children: [{name: &quot;#&quot;}, {name: &quot;a&quot;, children: null}, {name: &quot;b&quot;, children: [{name: &quot;b1&quot;}]}]};      model = qx.data.marshal.Json.createModel(model, true);
      tree.setModel(model);

As you see, a model is created having the following structure:

root
- #
- a
- b
-- b1

The # node does not have a children property and is therefore, rendered as leaf. The b node has a children property and children and is rendered as folder. But the a node has a children array but does not have children. It is rendered as a leaf but I would expect it to be rendered as a folder, even it does not have children.</thetext>
