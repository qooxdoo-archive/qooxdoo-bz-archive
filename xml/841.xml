            <thetext>I have a test function with 20 different tests of one function. This is verifying the return result with assertEquals. The function returns just true or false.

When a test fails there is no indication in the test output of the failure location. All I get is 

Error message is:
: Expected &#39;true&#39; but found &#39;false&#39;!
Stack trace:
abling.test.util.UTRangeManager:testIsTreePositionInRange
function()
etc

So the only way to track down the test that is failing is to debug the code.

At the very least the line number of the test failure should be shown but this wouldn&#39;t be much use in a build without source lines.

In other unit tests for example Python unit tests - http://docs.python.org/lib/testcase-objects.html - there are msg parameters to the tests which are shown in the output. That would be very helpful.

In addition if possible it would be very helpful to show the original parameters to the function call. This could be achieved by always having the parameters quoted and evaluating them, but that could get messy for compilation and so on.

            <thetext>This is in 0.7.3 by the way - the version field only allows Unspecified for the test runner.

            <thetext>The stack trace in FF is more informative:

abling.test.util.UTRangeManager:testIsTreePositionInRange
Error message is:
: Expected &#39;true&#39; but found &#39;false&#39;!
Stack trace:
abling.test.util.UTRangeManager:testIsTreePositionInRange:143
testrunner.TestFunction:53

This is with a source test. A compiled version shows the line number but it&#39;s not any use as the complete file is on one line.

            <thetext>Oops!

Feeling a bit hot under the collar here. Just did an api build of testRunner and found the msg parameters to all the asserts.

Sorry about that!

Bug withdrawn.
