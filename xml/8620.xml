            <thetext>With the new Chrome version, DirectDraw is enabled by default, which changes how the fonts are rendered.

In Chrome, the width of the labels are calculated wrong due to this reason.

This causes some issues with text inside labels as the text-overflow: ellipses is triggered for text that would normally fit within the label bounds. 

In &quot;qx.bom.element.Dimension&quot; getWidth, a float width value is calculated using element.getBoundingClientRect(). This is good in most cases, the problem is that if the decimal part of the with is lower than .5, width is rounded down.

Code looks like this:
    getWidth: function(element) {
      var rect = element.getBoundingClientRect();
      return Math.round(rect.right - rect.left);
    }

We did our own interim fix here was to use Math.ceil instead. of Math.round. Maybe there is another way to do this?

Thanks.

            <thetext>Thanks for the report. I just checked out some demos (widgetbrowser in version 4.0 and a playground build from master) with my chrome 37 on mac and could not see any ellipses. Do I need to change anything to reproduce the issue?
You solution sounds reasonable and should be easy to include first of all, it would be good if we could reproduce the issue. :)</thetext>

&gt; Could not reproduce the issue and no reaction since that --&gt; resolved.

Oh sorry for late reply. I realized that we&#39;re using an older version here with a few customizations. So my issue was probably due some some weird edge case with our code base.

Thanks for the help and quick response though.
