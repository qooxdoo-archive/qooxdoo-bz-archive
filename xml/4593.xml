            <thetext>This is a reminder bug. Don&#39;t fix it, don&#39;t close it, but create 
milestone-specific bugs that get fixed.

The CLDR data, currently under tool/data/cldr, needs to be updated from 
http://cldr.unicode.org/ (getting to e.g. 
http://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads). Use the data download of a released 
version. Do this way ahead of an upcoming release, so there is plenty of time 
to validate the data in applications.</thetext>

            <thetext>Usually, we don&#39;t add those kinds of bugs as reminder because there is work to do to fix it. As clarification, we do fix them but open up a new one for the upcoming release. Additionally, I tend to put them on P5.

Good idea adding bug for that and updating the data for every release. Maybe you can show me next time you update how you usually do it.</thetext>

            <thetext>Martin, I asked Thomas to open such a bug that&#39;s added new for each minor release. I guess you just meant that the add&#39;tl &quot;Reminder&quot; keyword was wrong, which is fine to remove then.</thetext>

            <thetext>So what is the use of the &#39;Reminder&#39; key anyway?! - I&#39;ve modelled this bug 
along one of the Sizzle bugs, which has a Reminder key word as well (bug#3897).</thetext>

            <thetext>Reminders are usually a tag for bugs we cant fix ourself like browser bugs we just need to check. Check out the new bug for sizzle which is the way this one is now. (#4353)</thetext>

&gt; Reminders are usually a tag for bugs we cant fix ourself like browser bugs we 
just need to check. Check out the new bug for sizzle which is the way this one 
is now. (#4353)

There are several bugs tagged &#39;Reminder&#39; which have nothing to do with waiting 
for action from outside. If those bugs need their own key word, it should be 
something like &#39;External&#39;. &#39;Reminder&#39; is something recurring you want to remind 
yourself of, and we should keep this meaning in the general sense. This does 
not preclude adding the &#39;Reminder&#39; key to &#39;External&#39; bugs.</thetext>
