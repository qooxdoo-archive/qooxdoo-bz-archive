            <thetext>base.json&#39;s &quot;common&quot; job has become a &quot;hook&quot; job for custom configs, meaning 
custom configs shadoe this job when they want to inject settings into all 
compile jobs.

- For one, this is not a published API, and people are not directed to this job 
to achieve the desired results. There should be a more dedicated include job 
for general compile settings (that are not already factored out into even more 
dedicated and truely published jobs, like &#39;cache&#39; or &#39;libraries&#39;). Something 
like &quot;build-common&quot; or &quot;compile-common&quot; or &quot;script-settings&quot;.

- If sensible, other more specialized jobs could be added, if a catch-all 
&quot;build-common&quot; appears to coars-grained.

- This hook job should then be documented accordingly.

- base.json needs an internal job to share common settings, but with a 
different name, e.g. &quot;base-common&quot;.

- Although this was never advised, maybe some thought should be spent on 
migration of the use of &quot;common&quot; job in custom configs.</thetext>
