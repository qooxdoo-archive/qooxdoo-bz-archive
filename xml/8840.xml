            <thetext>After updating to 4.0.2 (in 4.1 too) the double clicking is not correct on a unselected editable table cell. It is only after 3x click editable.

here is it ok

            <thetext>It seems that the first click is needed to focus the cell. If the cell is allready focused, a double click is sufficient to open the editor.</thetext>

            <thetext>Testing on our code reveals the following on 4.1:

When an unselected row is double clicked, it is emitting two cellTap events. When a selected row is double clicked, it is emitting two cellTap events followed by a cellDblTap event.

Thanks for looking into it.

I use the dblclick event for desktop and dbltap for tablets and mobile phones.
So now you can edit a unselected table cell only on desktops</thetext>

Hello,

We&#39;ve tested this on our application and the fix works fine on the desktop indeed, but when using mobile device user still needs to first select cell before start editing it with double click (as you actually state). But in 4.0.1 user could start editing cell without preselecting it on all the devices, and it is what our customers are accustomed to. Is the change in behaviour is intended then? Why it should be different between desktop and mobile devices?

Thanks you and regards,
Veronika.</thetext>

&gt; Is the change in behaviour is intended then? 
It only worked in 4.0.1 because it used a bug in the pointer / gesture layer which did not prevent double taps as on two different targets (as it should). After fixing that, the behavior changed and can not easily changed. 

&gt; Why it should be different between desktop and mobile devices?
We tried to think of other solutions to get the same behavior for both platforms but that would be a lot of effort due to the architecture of the table widget and its focus indicator (which is a overlay). So this is the best fix we can offer in the time we can spend.</thetext>
