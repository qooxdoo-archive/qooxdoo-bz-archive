            <thetext>This is bug report continues the work of Bug #5857.

From a comment of Bug #5857 by Katja Deutschmann:

--snip--
However it would be very helpful if Qooxdoo would make it possible to use 
background-position for background-images filtered with AlphaImageLoader. As 
far as I know the AlphaImageLoader internally converts the background-image 
into a &quot;normal&quot; image. Qooxdoo nearly positions everythings absolute and puts 
it into divs so why not creating an extra div, setting the background-image to 
that div, filter the background-image and position the wrapper div with the 
position settings made originally for the background-image. You&#39;ll find a few 
workarounds with google, but I think that one was common practise some years 
ago when everyone had to handle IE6.

This problem is really annoying as you cannot even position an image simply on 
the right side or at the bottom of somethings or even use &quot;normal&quot; sprites. 
That leads to long-winded workarounds with a lot more images and rows of code 
for things that are so easy with background-positioning.
