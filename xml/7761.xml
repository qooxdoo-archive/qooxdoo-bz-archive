            <thetext>This is a design bugreport originated from the discussion in #6064.

Separate package
----------------
Currently loaders are placed in ``qx.io`` directly. I could be a good idea to put them into dedicated namespace, ``qx.io.loader``. Since ``qx.io.part`` is internal package for ``qx.io.PartLoader``, it must be placed in ``qx.io.loader`` as well, keeping root packages in ``qx.io`` with clear and informative names. After fix of #7760, it would look like:

    io
    └─loader
    └─rpc
    └─request
    └─rest

Event vs callback
-----------------
Current implementation&#39;s event handling is based on callbacks which makes it inconsistent with event-based handling established in the framework.

It is also beneficial to have a similar way of operation among loaders, i.e. static or instance-based.

Script loader
-------------
Suddenly, #6064 resulted in removal of script loader, so current master&#39;s ``qx.io`` doesn&#39;t provide high-level script loading facility. Because the task of managing external code dependency frequently rises in native app development, it is important to keep ``qx.io`` feature-consistent in area of dependency management.</thetext>

            <thetext>Move open issues to RESOLVED – LATER, whose last comment is older than a year or we don&#39;t think it will be fixed in the near future.</thetext>
