            <thetext>Qooxdoo has introduced native SVG detection for a while now (since 0.7, if memory isn&#39;t failing me). That&#39;s fine enough for nowadays browsers, specially since IE9 has introduced native SVG support as well.

Enterprise-level applications (an area where qooxdoo is particularly good at) unfortunately don&#39;t usually work with the latest browser versions, and things like IE6 will still be &quot;in the wild&quot; for a few years.

Regarding SVG support, to try addressing that, I&#39;d propose integrating into the framework detection for ASV (Adobe SVG Viewer), the most widely-used plug-in for SVG support, which even used to work in several browsers (but its support has broke with browser evolution and native support, which was a Good thing).

The use case for this is determining when a browser has native SVG support, using qx.core.Environment.get(&quot;html.svg&quot;), and resort to plug-in detection before failing.

What do you think? I&#39;ve even quickly mashed-up a prototype implementation, based in the bug&#39;s URL code (see &quot;hasPluginSVG&quot; method) and would like to know whether a git push was appropriate or a &quot;plain&quot; patch was preferred. :-)</thetext>
