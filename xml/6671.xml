            <thetext>Hi,

My qooxdoo web app here: 
http://www.erh.noaa.gov/rlx/edd/

works without errors in most places, but for some reason on an iPhone and iPad using the safari browser it crashes.  I can&#39;t seem to get any error messages of what is making it crash. I did read that safari has at timeout option that may be the culprit.

Interestingly enough, it work on the iPhone 4S and the latest iPad.  I only found this bug since users of the site were emailing me that it crashes using their system.  Do you guys have any ideas or is there a way to ping the safari browser to tell it that it is not timing out? It&#39;s been a difficult bug to track down.

Thanks for any help you may have!</thetext>

            <thetext>Hey,
just gave it a try on my iPhone 4 and it stars as expected. I do have the iOS6 beta installed which might be the difference. Otherwise, we can&#39;t help you much here. :| If safari crashing, you might check the logs of the phone using XCode to get some details about the reason.
Sorry,
Martin</thetext>
