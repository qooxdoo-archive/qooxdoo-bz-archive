            <thetext>The built mobile themes &quot;flat.css&quot; and &quot;indigo.css&quot; should not be commited to repository.

Reasons:
- This causes merge conflicts, if you are building the theme with ruby SASS or pySCSS.
- The pre-built themes have to be copied by generator when a new app is created.
- If app developers never build their theme by their own through &quot;watch-scss&quot;, they never get improvements.

We should build the theme on mobile source and build jobs, for preventing these problems.</thetext>

            <thetext>Done. What has been changed:

* rm {flat,indigo}.css
* add .gitignore (with &#39;flat.css&#39; and &#39;indigo.css&#39;)
* add 3 new make targets in &#39;Makefile.release&#39;
   * resources-framework-check
   * resources-framework-build-css
   * resources-framework-build
* add two new generator (config) jobs
   * compile-scss (in &#39;config.tmpl.json&#39; for mobile)
   * compile-framework-scss (in &#39;base.json&#39;)
* add instructions to &#39;readme.txt&#39; if app was created without built &#39;indigo.css&#39;
* support &#39;command-not-found&#39; subproperty (message string) for generator config key &#39;shell&#39; (which runs shell jobs)
* run &#39;compile-scss&#39; job along with the following mobile jobs:
   * source
   * source-hybrid
   * source-all
   * build

Note:
&#39;clean&#39; and &#39;distclean&#39; won&#39;t remove the built css files, cause SCSS-compilation is still optional. If we require SCSS-compilation at some point for mobile, then we should also remove the build css files when running &#39;clean&#39; and &#39;distclean&#39;.

            <thetext>the qx.Mobile Showcase references the deleted CSS files.

We should have a job inside the Mobile Showcase which creates the CSS files into the mobile showcase app.

The app should reference the indigo.css and flat.css inside the &quot;Theming page&quot;.</thetext>

            <thetext>Next round:

mobile skeleton:
----------------
* remove minify jobs
* add mock content for &quot;custom.css&quot; (&quot;Content unstyled. Install Sass ...&quot;) which is shown only when app is created from master and no source/build version is created once yet.
* &quot;styles.css&quot; is gone (add own rules to &quot;_styles.scss&quot;)

apps (mobileshowcase, playground):
----------------------------------
* remove minify jobs
* mobileshowcase: &quot;styles.css&quot; is now &quot;_app.scss&quot;
* add .gitignore (to not bother with recreated CSS files)
* run &#39;compile-scss&#39; job along with the following jobs:
   * source
   * source-hybrid
   * source-all
   * build

With regard to SCSS the mobile skeleton, the mobileshowcase and the playground are now self-contained. The SCSS files remaining in the framework dirs are solely used for the load paths when running Sass. This means there is now a cleaner separation of SCSS files (app vs. framework). Furthermore there is no runtime dependency to any CSS file residing in the framework/SDK like before.

Note:
The theme switch (on the &quot;Theming&quot; page) for the mobileshowcase app is now broken - it has to be adapted.

&gt; Please make sure that compiled CSS of Mobile Skeleton are also ignored through
&gt; .gitignore .
&gt; 
&gt; Especially the &quot;custom.css&quot; inside source/resource/custom/css/

This makes sense for our apps but not for apps created on the basis of the mobile skeleton.

If somebody decides to not use Sass (while using Git) he would be prevented from committing his changes to the CSS files. I think it&#39;s better if people create a &quot;.gitignore&quot; file on their own.</thetext>

            <thetext>As we promote the way to use our SCSS theming, I would ignore the CSS file by default, through .gitignore .

In context of a qx.Mobile app, the CSS is a build artifact. If the user decides to go his own way, he should delete the .gitignore file.

As the bug title says &quot;Built qx.Mobile themes should not be commited to repository&quot;, ignoring the CSS file is mandatory.</thetext>

Okay, convinced. It&#39;s better to think forwards than backwards.

Well, didn&#39;t you mean the qooxdoo repo? :p ;)
