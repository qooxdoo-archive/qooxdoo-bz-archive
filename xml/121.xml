            <thetext>bugzilla is missing &#39;0.5.3&#39; and either &#39;namespaces&#39; or &#39;0.6&#39; in Version under frontend.  There should also probably be a &#39;trunk&#39; entry, for more long-term use.</thetext>

            <thetext>Missing versions 0.5.3 and trunk added. Thanks Derrell for the hint. ;-)

0.6 does not exist as a release yet, so no reason to have such a version entry.

The &quot;namespaces&quot; branch is soon to be moved back into the trunk, so also no need to introduce such a version now.

            <thetext>&quot;trunk&quot; is not a good name, since it doesn&#39;t define a version. When you see, that a bug was fixed in trunk then you don&#39;t know whether it is already fixed in a certain release (because it was fixed before the release) or whether it is only fixed in the *current* trunk.

I think &quot;0.6_dev&quot;, &quot;0.6_alpha&quot; or &quot;trunk_after_0.5.3&quot; or something like that would be better.</thetext>
