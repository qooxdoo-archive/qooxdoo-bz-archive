            <thetext>Hi !

I&#39;ve found a very strange behaviour with the mouse over event.

Everything is on the playground here : http://tinyurl.com/p3lekbz

To sum up the bug, I want to create an horizontal bar, and add some cliquable components on the bar when the user is rolling over, and remove them when the user is rolling out. I manage to do that but when I want to click on the component, I can&#39;t ! The roll over is not extended to the component and the roll out event is called before the mouse reach the component. Look at the playground and try to click on the yellow icon.

In my opinion, the good behaviour would be to extend dynamically the rollover to the component just added to the container.

Do you agree ?

            <thetext>Just checked the native behavior and it is the same:

http://jsfiddle.net/23WxZ/

If we check out the event that happen, the behavior is becoming clear.

Here is the change playground sample I used to reproduce:
http://tinyurl.com/q37anhz

&lt;&lt;move the mouse over the label&gt;&gt;
-&gt; mouseover on the label
-&gt; mouseover on the container

&lt;&lt; move mouse over to the icon&gt;&gt;
-&gt; mouseout of the label
-&gt; mouseout of the container --&gt; this hides the icon and with that, the mouse cursor is no longer over the container

As this is the native behavior I would not change anything here to fix the issue. It would be good to have a mouseenter and mouseleave envent for that but thats not supported at the moment. (see bug #7461).

A possible workaround is to use a async timer for hiding like in the following sample:
