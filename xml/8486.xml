            <thetext>The qx.core.Environment class is one of the basic parts of qooxdoo. It is included in every version of qooxdoo. But over time, it has become big and needs to be refactored. The reason of the size is mostly the huge _checksMap. This is a map containing all checks and a string reference to its check functions.
This map is used in tow different spots.

1. The environment class itself uses this map to decide which check function to call for which environment key. Instead of writing this map by hand, we could build it on runtime by using the displayName property of the added checks.

2. The generator uses this map to decide on the dependencies based on the environment keys used in the whole app. This algorithm could be adapted so the map is not required anymore. Here is how it could be done:
   1. Gather all used environment keys in a list named L
   2. check all classes for &#39;qx.core.Environment.add&#39; calls (start with the qx.bom.client namespace due to performance reasons)
      2.1 Put all added keys in a list named A
      2.2 if an item in A is in L, add the current class as dependency and delete all keys in A from L</thetext>
