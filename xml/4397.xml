            <thetext>Line 530 of qx.ui.layout.Dock.js:

flexibles = [];

should be replaced by 

flexibles = {};

like it is done a few lines above for the horizontal case. Using an array causes a bug later on Chrome due to the fact that

 for (key in flexibles) in computeFlexOffsets() can have some keys like map, reduce, etc (I think this was due to an external script like jQuery loaded into the page). Then child is null and there is an error a few lines later.

Anyway, this is clearly a typo and should be fixed ASAP. Thanks!

(PS: I made the fix myself and the bug vanished).</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report and analysis, it obviously is unintentional.

Fixed in r24190 (branch_1_2_x) and r24191 (trunk), also corrected JSDocs.

@Martin, please review and close.</thetext>

            <thetext>I don&#39;t see a reason why flexibles should be a map at all. Sure, its working that way but we always use numbers as keys so its kind of obvious that it could have been an array too in case we change the &quot;for (key in flexibles)&quot; to the right array access. But anyway, that is working too which is find for me.</thetext>
