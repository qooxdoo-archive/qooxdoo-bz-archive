            <thetext>&gt;&gt;&gt; Done (1m56.66)

shows 1 min 56 s and 660 milliseconds

1. milliseconds are irrelevant in this case -&gt; remove
2. minutes is abbreviated by min and NOT m

I would format the output too to this:

(Total time 1 min 56 s)</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report. I would keep the milliseconds because thats mainly a logging for performance optimization and in that case, sometimes milliseconds can make a big change. Think of the demo browsers where 700+ apps are build.
But still, the message could be a bit more speaking.</thetext>

            <thetext>The format of the information is this way for a purpose.

- 1m56.66 does *not* show 660 milliseconds, but 66 centiseconds, which is a 
difference. While I agree that milliseconds would not convey significant 
information, my experience confirms that centiseconds do.

- Hours are not relevant to convey, but minutes are. Therefore the only unit 
sign is &#39;m&#39;, and all other units derive from that.

- The entire format is the least intrusive for people that don&#39;t care, while 
still being informative for people that do.

- Compare the Bash built-in &#39;time&#39; and the Linux /usr/bin/time command, where 
the latter has no unit sign at all, but uses merely punctuation (e.g. 
&quot;1:56.66&quot;), also with centiseconds. And the former uses &#39;m&#39; for minutes, adds 
&#39;s&#39; to the end for seconds, and displays milliseconds (e.g. &quot;1m56.667s&quot;).

- I think the format used in the generator is a very good compromise between 
information, readability and non-intrusiveness.

In short, the way the information is displayed is exactly the way I want it, 
and I don&#39;t think your taste weighs in more heavily than mine.

&gt; It is not about your or my taste! Use ISO standard!

Stefan, you don&#39;t want to start arguing about such a minor thing, right? I think we have more important things to consider during the development of the framework than if everyone likes how the generator prints out the time its needed. Thomas wrote a good answer why its the way it is and I don&#39;t want  anyone in the team to spend more time on such minor discussion.</thetext>

            <thetext>Absolutely no argumentation, but nothing had been said about standards so I added that for future review. He answered, yes, but no good answer at all. But don&#39;t take it as a start of an argumentation. Case closed!</thetext>
