            <thetext>Whenver a pointer listener is added to an element the native mouse events are stopped. 

This implementation may have influence for application code and/or third-party libs. The main issue here is that the behaviour changes based on the fact whether an event listener is added to an element or not. Especially the &#39;window&#39; and &#39;document&#39; elements are interesting here.

So getting over this &#39;stopPropagation&#39; implementation is preferable.</thetext>

            <thetext>I modified the native event listeners in PointerCore so that they add a &#39;$$qxProcessed&#39; property to the event objects instead of calling stopPropagation on them. If this property is already set, event is ignored. This should have the same effect in that other PointerCore instances above the current element in the DOM tree won&#39;t fire additional Pointer events for bubbling native events. However, I strongly suspect we had good reasons for using stopPropagation that I just can&#39;t remember right now, so this needs to be reviewed extra carefully.

(Tentatively) fixed with c695bc4ba06e8c921ca4a33ca650a4834f701330 (master)</thetext>
