            <thetext>An issue with current demobrowser is the fact that demos are stand-alone apps that are loaded in an iframe. This makes browsing through and switching between demos slow.

The demos should therefore become part of the demobrowser application.</thetext>

            <thetext>- Stand-alone: A constraint of the new solution is that demos must remain runnable by themselves. This is a requirement for the framework developement, which uses demos to develop new features.

If demos become parts of a larger application, it should be possible to have a generic application frame (index.html + helper classes) that is able to plug-in any of those demos and run them as stand-alone apps, outside the demobrowser.

- Theming: Another open issue is theming. Currently, all demos come in two themes. This is achieved by generating two versions of the same demo. If demos become a part of the demobrowser application, how can we theme this particular part, without changing the theme of the whole demobrowser?

            <thetext>The general question remains how to better integrate the demos with the 
demobrowser, but the requirements and the perspective on what is considered 
&quot;better&quot; has possibly changed. The newer bug (#2482) tries to reflect that, so 
I&#39;m closing this one.
