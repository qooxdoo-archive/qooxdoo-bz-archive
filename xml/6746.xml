            <thetext>Right now the &quot;provider&quot; job does generate a &quot;resources.json&quot; file in the &quot;date/resource&quot; folder with the information about the used resources.

This file can contain references to e.g. the qooxdoo library and resources of this library. 

The goal is that only the resources of the current library are listed in the &quot;resources.json&quot; to avoid collisions during runtime.</thetext>

            <thetext>Cannot quite confirm.

The provider job *does* only list those resources in resources.json that are 
contained in the local library. But in this specific case, the library contains 
a combined image which in turn contains images from the qooxdoo framework. As 
these images are contained in the combined image, they are contained in the 
library proper. Therefore, they are listed in resources.json. It does not 
matter that the resource *id&#39;s* are those of a foreign library.

Generally, it is fine for qooxdoo libraries to even maintain single image files 
in their resource folder which have the same resource id as those from another 
library. This is to allow for overwriting of images.</thetext>

            <thetext>It was another issue. So from my point of view we can close this one as INVALID.</thetext>
