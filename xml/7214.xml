            <thetext>I experienced the problem while trying to get the offline data storage to work with a tree.  It turns out the problem was not with the offline storage but with the use of a delegate to process the data.  If the controller delegate was set after the binding of the data store to the controller, the tree would only get populated the first time. When I loaded the page again and the data was read from the offline storage the tree would not get populated.  If the delegate is set after the before the binding the tree is always populated correctly.

Here is a playground example with the delegate set in the working location:

Quick summary of the change to demonstrate the working vs not working scenarios:
Works:

this._controller = new qx.data.controller.Tree(null, this._someTree, &quot;children&quot;, &quot;name&quot;);
this._controller.setDelegate(treeDelegate);  // delegate set before binding
this._store.bind(&quot;model&quot;, this._controller, &quot;model&quot;);

Does not work:

this._controller = new qx.data.controller.Tree(null, this._someTree, &quot;children&quot;, &quot;name&quot;);
this._store.bind(&quot;model&quot;, this._controller, &quot;model&quot;);
this._controller.setDelegate(treeDelegate); // delegate set after binding</thetext>
