            <thetext>We currently think that fixing the local handling within the next repo is not worth the effort as this could be done on the server side of apps as well. So removing this feature would include the following things:

1. remove the locale namespace including all relations to it
2. remove all tests
3. check if the build still contains the data and remove that as well</thetext>

Yes, at the moment. But that does not mean that it will never be in there but at the moment, it does not have the priority to get fixed so we get it simply out of the way to get a cleaner code base.</thetext>

            <thetext>We should keep in mind that the skeletons feature translation folders as well which might not be necessary anymore.</thetext>

OK, but as soon as the next branch becomes the successor of the current master, the locale system should be in place again. 

If not, there will be a lot of code change necessary in order to do localization by &quot;server side of apps&quot; as you wrote.</thetext>

            <thetext>Deleted the locale classes, translations and related jobs, and the CLDR data.

            <thetext>dont be upset. nexst is just a experimental project for internal needs. no need to use this in your enviroment. by the way it seems to me very hard to fit a runnung current qx-project as next-project.</thetext>
