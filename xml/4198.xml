            <thetext>There seems to be a timing problem when using qx.bom.Blocker. Before the (modal) popup window is created a timer is started in sourcecode. Sometimes it takes a little bit longer to open / create the window. The timer checks after 500ms, if there is still a opened popup. If not, the blocker component is removed. In my case the timer checks faster than the popup opens --&gt; result: the blocker appears, directly disappears again and after that the popup opens.

Maybe the listener in line 174 should also be removed again somewhere in the code?

this.__timer.addListener(&quot;interval&quot;, this.__checkForUnblocking, this);</thetext>

            <thetext>The timer is now started after the window open is called. I hope this solves the timing issue. Done on trunk with r23542 and branch with r23543. Please reopen the bug if the issue still exists.

Thanks for the hint with the &quot;interval&quot; listener. I have done a look and It is okay.</thetext>
