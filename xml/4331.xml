            <thetext>I set a label&#39;s value on &#39;mouseover&#39; and &#39;mouseout&#39;. The &#39;mouseout&#39; event is sometimes not fired with the following configurations:
Chrome 7.0.517.44 on OSX and Windows XP
Safari 5.0.1 on OSX
Internet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702 on Windows XP

It always seems to work with Firefox 3.6 on both OSX and XP.

The event seems to go missing when the mouse is moved away from the label very quickly, so that it &quot;touches&quot; another widget almost immediately. Does seem to work when I slowly move the mouse cursor away.</thetext>

            <thetext>I was unable to reproduce this. Tested with Chrome or Safari on Mac with this example:

  I cannot reproduce it in this example either and the problem still does not show-up when I put the label in a container that listens for mouse-events too. The latter is the case in my application, where the problem shows.

  So, I think there must be a strange bug in my application, since events are obviously not going missing.

  Thanks for the effort to look at it though.
