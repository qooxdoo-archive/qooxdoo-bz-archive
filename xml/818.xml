            <thetext>Qooxdoo&#39;s timer implementation uses &#39;setInterval&#39;, which has a caveat in Gecko-based browsers: there is a rather old bug [2] which makes intervals not being respected.

I&#39;ve noticed this while using timed actions (which output a debug line, somehow similar to an existing test case [2]). The chances that this symptom is displayed increase with CPU load and if the browser temporarily pauses such as during a sync request and/or heavy JS processing.

Although I haven&#39;t yet attempted (so I don&#39;t even know if it&#39;s possible), proposal consists in changing Timer class implementation:
«A workaround is to cancel the timer (using clearInterval()) each time it is executed, and then regenerating the timer again - or, alternately, using setTimeout() repeatedly.» [2]

This issue doesn&#39;t seem to affect Firefox 3 (at least, not as much [2] and not noticed in my tests), therefore IMHO it make sense to address this in time for maintenance release 0.7.4 - for 0.8 probably Firefox 3 will already be «in the wild».

            <thetext>By the way, I&#39;d like to suggest to overall change the timer.once implementation to &quot;setTimeout&quot; instead of &quot;setInterval&quot; - I don&#39;t see any advantage in using &quot;setInterval&quot; (which has to be canceled afterward) for one shot timers... ;-)</thetext>

            <thetext>Since Firefox 3 has been out a while we will not fix this issue.

Helder, your recommendation is correct: it would be better to use 
window.setTimeout for all once timers. Unfortunately this would break the API 
since once() returns a timer object which can be restarted and used again. I do 
not know how many single shot timers are being used more than one time, but we 
do not want to break existing code.</thetext>

&gt; Since Firefox 3 has been out a while we will not fix this issue.
Well, I must say that, unfortunately, this is still reproduced in Firefox 3. Although it&#39;s pretty much harder to reproduce, while the browser is experiencing a high load it does reproduce more often. And high load is what medium-to-complex qooxdoo applications cause to browsers... ;-)
Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t yet able to create an easy to reproduce procedure for updating (the already stated Firefox) bug report. :-|


&gt; Helder, your recommendation is correct: it would be better to use 
&gt; window.setTimeout for all once timers.

Yes, I&#39;d say this is conceptually more appropriate. :-)

Humm... I don&#39;t quite agree with this. The method &quot;setTimeout&quot; can also be canceled (through &quot;clearTimeout&quot;) and/or restarted (setting up another &quot;setTimeout&quot; call), similarly to &quot;setInterval&quot;/&quot;clearInterval&quot;). Adjusting the implementation would, in my opinion, create a more robust and more elegant timing mechanism (for &quot;once&quot; calls).


Nevertheless, this issue is left closed if/until someone else agrees with this: maybe I&#39;m erroneously assuming something...</thetext>

            <thetext>Rather than changing qx.client.Timer, it wouldn&#39;t hurt to port qx.event.Idle and qx.util.TimerManager from 0.8 to 0.7.  Those modules should port pretty easily, and provide the &quot;proper&quot; single native timer regardless of number of qooxdoo timers in use.
