            <thetext>Both methods are not working anymore, since theme includes/patches are not supported anymore at runtime. 
It is only possible to add the include into your appearance theme to perform the include at generation time.

-&gt; Mark both methods as deprecated to remove them later on.</thetext>

            <thetext>Fixed with Revision #16995.

It was only necessary to add the methods &quot;resolve&quot; and &quot;isDynamic&quot; to the Font and the Color theme to ensure the runtime include/patch of themes is working again.
Both themes are based on the &quot;qx.util.ValueManager&quot; class and hold their values in caches. Both methods were changed to support the included/patched values of the themes. 

If any uncached value has to resolved the theme is checked for an entry and if available this value is cached and returned.</thetext>
