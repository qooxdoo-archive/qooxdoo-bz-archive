            <thetext>Particularly in the following section, but possibly also within the regular page content. Should be checked and fixed. http://manual.qooxdoo.org/devel/pages/introduction/about.html#more-information-online

On a general note, it seems to get harder to keep the About page and its references in sync with changes to the homepage, since the About page is now managed as a manual page?</thetext>

            <thetext>I&#39;ve moved the link list in the &quot;More information&quot; section to the wiki 
(qooxdoo.org/project). We had something like this earlier, and it seems indeed 
more sensible to maintain these links in the wiki directly. The manual now has 
only the single link to this wiki page. I think this is the better solution.

The About page was a special case, as it was duplicated between the wiki and 
the manual.  I&#39;ll fix up the other links in the manual page as well, but most 
of them are less volatile (qooxdoo.org/license, qooxdoo.org/community, etc.).
