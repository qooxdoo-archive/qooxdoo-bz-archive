            <thetext>Several file names in the repo contain version strings, particularly q modules 
(e.g. &quot;q-core-3.1.min.js&quot;). But those versioned file names are only necessary 
for our download page where people can download a particular version of a 
module, and in the &#39;website&#39; skeleton.

Within the repo, though, these versioned names are not necessary, and 
complicate file handling. There are multiple places where there has to be an 
agreement over these version strings, e.g. when copying modules into skeletons, 
generating an SDK, running the index.html of a low-level app, or bumping 
version strings for a new version.

It seems it would suffice if all file names where free of version strings, 
except when publishing modules to the download site. This case can be easily 
handled in the Makefile.release which copies those files to the download path.

The other case where you would want a version string in the file name is when 
creating a &#39;website&#39; application from the skeleton. The q module copied to the 
script/ folder should be versioned, and hence the reference in the index.html 
and test/index.html.</thetext>

            <thetext>The repo is now again basically free of version strings in generated file 
names.  This includes generated files shipped with the SDK. The only notable 
exception are the q modules archives (e.g. website/script/q-modules-3.1.js.zip) 
because they are pure download artefacts, only created during &#39;Makefile.release 
publish&#39;, and not used elsewhere.

Version strings are only applied to file names on deployment, e.g. when q 
modules are copied into a fresh skeleton (during create-application.py), or 
into the download area of demo.qooxdoo.org (during Makefile.release 
publish-apps).
