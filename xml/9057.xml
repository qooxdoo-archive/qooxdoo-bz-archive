            <thetext>We already have grunt in use for qooxdoo as a frontend but we also have some parts of the generator implemented as grunt task. As we currently focus on finishing the JavaScript based toolchain for next, I don&#39;t think its happening that we replace all the current generator features with JavaScript (read part loading, static optimizer, ...). Having that in mind, there is no need to keep the JavaScript based implementation of some tasks around. Most of them are not in the user facing API anyway so from the user side, this should not change much but would allow us to focus.</thetext>

            <thetext>Reduced grunt config to bare minimum and removed all grunt tasks and their packages. Grunt is now only a thin (optional) wrapper over the generator.

The intended use case is to combine existing/custom grunt plugins with the Generator.
