            <thetext>We have had an issue with poor performance when calling the setTableModel function in the qx.ui.table.Table widget for a few releases now when the table has a large number of columns (30+), previous investigations assumed it was purely to do with the fact that the widget supports virtual rows but not virtual columns however I have done some more investigation and found that the performance issues disappear if the TableModel is passed into the constructor which subsequently calls the setTableModel. I believe it may have something to do with the way the widget  functions differently when a tableModel has already been set.

You can view an example in the playground below. To view the fast performance using the constructor comment out the empty contructor and the setTableModel lines at the bottom of the code block.

It seems to be based purely on the number of columns as the performance difference is minimal when extra rows are added.
