            <thetext>Chromes cache behavior is a  bit to aggressive. So resources are often comming from cache, even if the modified date changed.

In context of combined images (sprites) this behavior results in ugly effects.

I would prefer a nocache param for image resources, which changes just only on file changes.</thetext>

            <thetext>Are you sure that chrome behavior is restricted to images only? Do you have a chromium bug to verify your thesis? If not, why not open one? In the end, sounds like a browser bug which should be fixed in the browser. We can only put in workarounds and for that, we should know the exact scope of the misbehavior like what file types can be affected.</thetext>

            <thetext>Bug#6164 is having similar issues. Among others, it names two Chromium bugs 
that are related to caching (1906, 44122). One workaround that is offered there 
is using the HTTP &quot;Cache-Control: no-cache&quot; header on the response, which can 
be set e.g. in Apache&#39;s .htaccess files (see comment#9).

On a general note I agree that if we want to address this, it has to be done on 
a more general level than just sprites. E.g. all static resources need to be 
considered. On the script level, scripts are already generated with a hash in 
their file names, except for the loader script so not to break the link from 
the index.html. But maybe this also has to be reconsidered.</thetext>
