            <thetext>The current implementation doesn&#39;t allow to use a hidden iframe to download files.

The first problem is that the iframe (DOM element) is not added when the embed is directly set to hidden:

The second problem is that the source is not applied when the iframe (DOM element) is added to the DOM, but the embed is hidden:

I expect that an embed is not optimized and the iframe is added to the DOM when it is hidden. Also the source should applied to the iframe when the embed is hidden.

Here a workaround to use the embed as hidden iframe. Just set the container element to &quot;display none&quot;:

This was a tricky one because the element queue is really not easy to handle. I ended up by adding the iframe to the modified element queue on creating and added a special case for iframes in the queue itself to make sure the DOM element is created when the iframe is not visible.

&gt; The second problem is that the source is not applied when the iframe (DOM
&gt; element) is added to the DOM, but the embed is hidden:

Fixed that by applying the source directly.
