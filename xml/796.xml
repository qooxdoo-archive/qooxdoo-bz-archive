            <thetext>Platform:
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9b4pre) Gecko/2008021904 Minefield/3.0b4pre


Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the proposed URL (both ListView [2] and Table widget trigger the behavior);
2. Try to scroll the widget: not by dragging the scroll bar but by clicking between the down arrow and the bar itself (nothing happens);
3. Drag the scroll bar near to the middle and repeat 2.. Also, click the portion between the up arrow and the bar itself.


Expected Results:
The bar scrolls up/down, if the click is, respectively, in the portion above/below the bar.


Actual Results:
The bar scrolls up if the portion bellow the bar is clicked, and scrolls down if the portion above is clicked - the behavior is reversed.


Additional Information:
Symptom isn&#39;t shown in Firefox 2 - tested with 2.0.0.11.

The behavior depends on qooxdoo-version and widget used:
 * Doesn&#39;t happen on 0.6.x versions&#39; ListView [1] - tested 0.6.5 to 0.6.7;
 * Happens using 0.6.x versions&#39; Table - tested 0.6.5 to 0.6.7;
 * Happens using 0.7.x versions&#39; ListView [2] and Table - tested 0.7 to 0.7.3;
 * Happens using 0.8.x versions&#39; ListView [3] and Table - tested 0.8-pre2.

This issue was originally reported as a possible Firefox issue in a mailing list thread [4]. Further testing helped isolating the issue to qooxdoo-specific code.

            <thetext>Not able to reproduce the issue - magically fixed! :-)

Marking as invalid as it seems that the issue was erroneously identified as a qooxdoo issue and now there seems to be evidence that it was, in fact, located in Firefox code (no new changes happened in the mean time in the test links provided).

Additional notes:
I suspect that this was possibly related with a (Mozilla&#39;s) core layout bug [1] which was recently fixed.
