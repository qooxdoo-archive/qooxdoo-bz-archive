            <thetext>In some minor cases (like 1 out of 10), i can reach a bug on that file :

qx.ui.core.queue.Layout


The function &quot;flush&quot; raise an error because the bounds is not yet ready, but the layout is.

This correct the bug :

var bounds = widget.getBounds();

if(bounds === null){
  return;
}

widget.renderLayout(bounds.left, bounds.top, bounds.width, bounds.height);


This cause the system to stop boundary, and wait for next queue (and the bug is removed as far as I know).

PS : the widget loaded is heavy, that&#39;s probably why there is loading distance from layout queue rendering and widget rendering.</thetext>

            <thetext>This sounds like an application error to me. It is most likely that you access any element before it is rendered. In most of the cases, the rendering is done but in the 10% cases, the rendering is not done and therefore, the bounds can not be used. This is a programming error and should not simple be ignored by the queues.
As I don&#39;t have anything to reproduce and prove that its a framework issue, I can&#39;t do much about it right now. Could you check if it&#39;s an application problem and reopen the issue in case you have a running sample for us to debug?</thetext>
