            <thetext>With the recent addition of an event emitter, we have the possibility to fire events without the already existing event layer. This enables the framework to use events without using qx.Class. But without qx.Class, you can not define the events in the class map which leads to undocumented events.

We could consider something similar like @throw for adding events e.g. @event for API docs which then are also listed in an events section in the API viewer.</thetext>

            <thetext>We decided to also add an events map to bootstrap classes to document events. This keeps the way of adding events the same way for bootstrap and class and also enables the API viewer to stay the way it was. The Bootstrap.define method does not care about these events declaration which is also good. Additionally, we keep the possibility to use these event declarations for data binding.

I already added a documentation to qx.bom.element.AnimationHandle which does not have an event objects as argument for the callback. Seems like the API generation falls back to an data event so we should check that and allow all kinds of types.</thetext>

            <thetext>The API doc for AnimationHandle looks like it&#39;s supposed to. Perhaps this was fixed with some other bug?</thetext>
