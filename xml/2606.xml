            <thetext>The very first version of hijax had a form validation included. It was very much mixed with the rest of the hijax code.

During the refactoring of the hijax code, we extracted the form validation code and moved it to the class FormValidation (which is currently not used). In the Hijax class are a few hooks to this class left, which are commented out.

If someone wants the client-side form validation back, then he may refactor this code and bring it back to work. But the code should stay seperate from the hijax code. So hijax and form validation could be used with or without the other. Maybe the code should be moved to an extra contrib project...</thetext>
