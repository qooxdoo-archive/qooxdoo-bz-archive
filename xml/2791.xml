            <thetext>Object has addListeners, hasListener, and removeListener methods, but no getListeners method. It seems like Object should have a getListeners method as well.</thetext>

            <thetext>Not sure if this is a good idea. I would highly prefer to limit access to add/remove/has here. The getListeners method would return some kind of internal data structure (or need to copy and re-format it). Would be interesting what use-cases exist for such an API before introducing it.</thetext>

            <thetext>My use case was just that my superclass constructor added listeners which I needed to remove. However, that need could be satisfied by just letting me remove *all* listeners for a particular event, not by letting me inspect the internal data structures. This might often lead to unintended consequences, though...
