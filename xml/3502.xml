            <thetext>The column-specific context menu mixin &quot;qx.ui.table.MTableContextMenu&quot; does not display a context menu on any Windows browser I checked. No browsers display an error associated with the problem.

I develop on a Mac (OSX 10.5.8), and the context menu DOES work on the following browsers:
Safari 4.0.4
Chrome 5.0.307.11 Beta
Firefox 3.5.8

The browsers I was able to test on Windows where my example does NOT work:
Safari 4.0.4 (Windows XP)
Internet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702 (Windows XP)
Firefox 3.5.8 (Windows XP, Windows 7)
Chrome, latest stable and beta as of 3/4/10 (Windows XP, Windows 7)

The problem can also be observed at http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/demobrowser/#table~Table_Context_Menu.html.</thetext>

            <thetext>Yes, we&#39;ve had a few reports of MTableContextMenu failing with Windows browsers. I don&#39;t have a decent Windows development environment set up right now. If anyone wants to try to work on this, I&#39;d be glad for the help. We did have a report from Mustafa Sak that the following is a workaround, and may be applicable to fixing the mixin:

var optionMenu = new qx.ui.menu.Menu;
table.setContextMenu(optionMenu);
 
table.addListener(&quot;mousedown&quot;, function(){
   optionMenu.removeAll();
   optionMenu.add(new qx.ui.menu.Button(&quot;Test &quot; + Math.random()));
});

    I&#39;ve found that if you disable the focus indicator, like so:

    widget.getPaneScroller(0).setShowCellFocusIndicator(false);

    then the context menu works. So it appears that the focus indicator eats
    contextMenu events.

            <thetext>Should be fixed in r22236. Tested in Linux Firefox and on Windows Firefox and IE.

Assigning to Martin to resolve to FIXED since I can&#39;t do it until the dependency, bug 3709, is closed.

Events are dispatched in different orders on Linux and Windows. On Windows, by
the time the contextmenu event was dispatched, the information about where the
user had clicked had been discarded. This commit corrects that. The cell upon
which a mousedown event occurs is saved and no longer discarded by any of the
various mouseup handlers. I&#39;ve added a big &quot;INVARIANT&quot; comment that will
hopefully prevent people form re-adding clearing of the object which tracks
the mousedown location.

As a nice side effect of this fix, the various Table events that are generated
to the user now properly contain the row and column in which the event
occurred. Previously, the object containing the click location was cleared
BEFORE issuing the events to the user, so the row and column members of the
event data was always null.

            <thetext>Ok, I managed to remove the dependency. Marking as fixed.
