            <thetext>This enhancement request has the following motivation:
Our application shall integrate apps that were programmed by third-party developers.
The tables (qx.ui.table.Table) that were created by third-party developers shall have a style that matches our styleguide.
The problem is that the implementation of the styleguide requires additional JavaScript-code, because some table styles are hard-coded in the qooxdoo-code and cannot be changed by appearances.
Therefore we have to say to all the third-party developers:
  &quot;Do not use qx.ui.table.Table, but use the subclass ourapplication.ui.table.Table instead.&quot;
  &quot;Otherwise your table will have the wrong style.&quot;
We want to get rid of this constraint.
Therefore we request that the table styles can be influenced by appearances.

We have identified the following hard-coded styles in the qooxdoo-code that we have currently to change programmatically:

-- snip ------------------------------------------------
qx.Class.define(&quot;qx.ui.table.rowrenderer.Default&quot;,
   createRowStyle : function(rowInfo)
   {
     ...
     rowStyle.push(&#39;;border-bottom: 1px solid &#39;, this.__colors.horLine);

-- snip ------------------------------------------------
Our styleguide requires that border-bottom has a height of 0 px.


-- snip ------------------------------------------------
qx.Class.define(&quot;qx.ui.table.cellrenderer.Abstract&quot;,
{
  construct : function()
  {
      var stylesheet =
        &quot;.qooxdoo-table-cell {&quot; +
        qx.bom.element.Style.compile(
        {
          position : &quot;absolute&quot;,
          top: &quot;0px&quot;,
          overflow: &quot;hidden&quot;,
          whiteSpace : &quot;nowrap&quot;,
          borderRight : &quot;1px solid &quot; + colorMgr.resolve(&quot;table-row-line&quot;),
          padding : &quot;0px 6px&quot;,
-- snip ------------------------------------------------
Our styleguide requires different paddings.

By the way: the qooxdoo-appearance defines two colors:
&quot;table-row-line&quot; and &quot;table-column-line&quot;.
The first color is used twice, the second color is never used.
This is probably a bug.


This enhancement request has the same motivation as the enhancement request bug #4625.</thetext>

            <thetext>Changing the styles of the cells is done with the use of (own) cellrenderer. 
This is by design and there will be no possibility in the future to be able to 
set this with appearances.

The reason behind this is that the cellrenderer code is highly tied to the 
table infrastructure (calculating the scrolling / virtual infrastructure) and 
cannot be easily replaced by appearances.

One alternative could be to hand in a custom cellrenderer with the &quot;custom&quot; map 
(second parameter of the constructor) and be able to customize a table instance 
this way. Feel free to open an enhancement bug if you like to see this feature 
in an upcoming release.

Thanks for pointing out the superfluous color &quot;table-column-line&quot;!</thetext>
