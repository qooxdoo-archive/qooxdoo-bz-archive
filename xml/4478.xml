            <thetext>when this is run in the qooxdoo config.json directory:

./generate.py lint

the following error/warning in hundreds (for different files) is printed out:

qooxdoo/frontend/framework/source/class/qx/ui/core/Command.js (40,8): Protected data field in &#39;this._shortcut&#39;. Protected data fields are deprecated. Better use private fields in combination with getter and setter methods.

The question is if the message should be shown or not? Is the intention to convert all protected to private? If it should be shown, it might be better to tweak the message a little to avoid misunderstanding. It also looks like the framework is under work, which I believe might create a misunderstanding.

What do you think?</thetext>

            <thetext>Its interesting that you come up with that topic. We just had a talk about exactly that warning today! We already have a bug for that, which is why i mark that one as duplicate. But we will find a solution and either remove the warning or make it more clear at least.

            <thetext>yes, it looks better. Else unnoticed people might think the framework is erroneous or maybe not wisely programmed.</thetext>
