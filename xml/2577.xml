            <thetext>When using the Resize column model of the table in IE it *can* occur that the model does try to set the width to a negative value causing the browser to break.

The negative value is handed over to the &quot;set&quot; method of &quot;qx.bom.element.Style&quot;, so it seems this value does get calculated by the HBox layout. A HBox layout is only used to calculate the width of the columns but is not part of the GUI.</thetext>

--snip--
I came across a weird problem yesterday where IE8 would give an &quot;Invalid
argument&quot; exception where FF3 was fine; this was harmless if you had had the
IE8 debugger running but if not would cause the Qooxdoo app to completely
stop responding.

By elimination I eventually tracked it down to a table which had no explicit
&quot;width&quot; and which had a column also with no explicit width;  I haven&#39;t been
able to produce a reasonable test case so I&#39;m posting my findings in case it
makes more sense to someone else!

The error occurred on line 335 of qx/bom/element/Style.js, where the code is
setting the &quot;width&quot; property to &quot;-1px&quot;.  This was set by a call to
qx.ui.Element.setStyle where the stack trace was:

        Widget.js line 928, function renderLayout:
&quot;content.setStyle(&quot;width&quot;, innerWidth + pixel);&quot;
        Grid.js line 1282, function renderLayout (cellWidth=4)

            <thetext>Since Bug #2631 is fixed now by Martin, I guess this also fixes this issue.

@Fabian: I&#39;m pretty sure we can mark this one as duplicate of Bug #2631.</thetext>

            <thetext>Yes, it is a duplicate.
