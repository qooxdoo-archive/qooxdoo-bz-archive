            <thetext>The 0.7 legacy apps will be migrated to use widgets from the qx.legacy.* name space. This name space will be moved to qooxdoo-contrib, under some suitable name (e.g. &quot;qx07compat&quot;).
Legacy applications will need to download that contrib, so they will have the benefit of the migration. A pre-defined config.json shall be prepared for the inclusion of this contrib. This config can then be utilized during the create-application process.</thetext>

            <thetext>The qx.legacy.* name space has been excluded from framework apiviewer (which was one of the concerns of leaving qx.legacy in the framework).

The extraction and subsequent downloading of the qx.legacy.* name space to and from qooxdoo-contrib can be done post 0.8-final.

            <thetext>There will only be a limited number of future 0.8+ releases that allow for the &quot;hybrid&quot; mode for migrating legacy apps. After that, migration should be done with the latest of these hybrid releases, but then following the regular migration between 0.8+ releases. The available hybrid releases are independent of the fact that the legacy code may be included from qooxdoo-contrib.</thetext>

            <thetext>@Andreas: Is the goal of putting the qx.legacy classes in a contrib that can be 
downloaded still valid? Then we should settle on the name of the contrib, so I 
can create it and start copying the qx.legacy.* classes to it.</thetext>

            <thetext>Not sure a config as described is needed (or even sufficient). The legacy part of the SDK doesn&#39;t only include the qx.legacy classes, but for instance the resources/qx/compat.

Wouldn&#39;t a contribution, that is also downloadable as a zip archive which extracts into a qooxdoo SDK folder, be sufficient or am I missing something? That would of course involve a manual step by the user for setting up the migration environment, but I guess that is ok given the many steps he/she has to make anyway. Thoughts?

            <thetext>resolved this bug as INVALID, since the legacy part (qx.legacy.* and resources/qx/compat for instance) was kept until and including 0.8.3 and then removed. See comment #2 for the strategy to migrate from a 0.7.x app into a &quot;hybrid&quot; release (latest being 0.8.3) if needed.</thetext>
