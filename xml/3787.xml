            <thetext>Running demobrowser I have in console

message, which is from qx.io.remote.transport.XmlHttp. Running testrunner I&#39;ve

Apiviewer fails with

I&#39;ve had Chrome 1, which was working correctly via file protocol. For me actually, Chrome is very specific purpose tool in my qooxdoo-related development view. The purpose is to view api and demos, because they make Firefox feel less responsive. Obviously, this has some irony ;)</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report. This is a known issue and a &quot;feature&quot; by chrome (see bug #3622 for details). Sorry but we can&#39;t do much about it currently.
