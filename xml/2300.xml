            <thetext>In this bug in Mozilla (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=312156) there was mentioned that something was changed regarding ellipsis support in Gecko. We should verify that ellipsis still works in qooxdoo with the latest Firefox.

Also interesting is comment 73 (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=312156#c73) where someone suggest that it still works to add a behavior to the element. If this really works it would be an alternative for our implementation as well. This might have the benefit that we could add support for ellipsis in labels with HTML and might also re-add support for mnemonics.</thetext>

            <thetext>It seems to be still working in Firefox 3.0.9. If the CSS hack is working I would be very happy
to use it as replacement for the XUL hack.

quote from the Mozilla bug:

The following CSS still works in Fx 3.09 Mac for me.

div#subMenu h2 {
-moz-binding:url(ellipsis.xml#ellipsis);
overflow:hidden;
white-space:nowrap;
width:150px;
}</thetext>

            <thetext>I have changed qx.bom.Label to use XBL bindings instead of XUL labels. This removes
a lot of special cases in this class. It looks like the result is exactly the same.

I was hoping this would enable us to allow text selections by removing this binding but
it seems once the binding has been attached there is no way to enable text selection #1530 .

fixed in r19654</thetext>

            <thetext>Using XBL seems to be more problematic than initially expected:

1. XBL bindings are subject to the same origin policy. This makes it impossible to use them
   e.g. in a gadget context. If the XBL file could not be loaded no strings are displayed at all.
   Using data URI are prohibited as well.
   
 2. In some cases changing the value of a label doesn&#39;t seem to be rendered correctly.
 
 I think we have to revert to using XUL labels.</thetext>
