            <thetext>When the qx.ui.table.Table has scrollbars, a mouseout event will be fired on the table if you hover between pane and scrollbar. See this example http://tinyurl.com/cvp3ef9 and try: 1. hover the pane and move the mouse to the right until you enter the scrollbar, 2. hover the scrollbar and move the mouse to the left until you enter the pane. In both cases a mouseout event will be fired.</thetext>

            <thetext>This seems to be a general issue with all widgets having a scroll container. In fact, this is how every child widget works if its not set to anonymous. The atom&#39;s label and icon are anonymous which is why this works. Most of the other widgets behave the same way as the table.

See the list sample e.g. which will fire a over and out event on every list item.


var list = new qx.ui.form.List();
this.getRoot().add(list);

for (var i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++) {
  list.add(new qx.ui.form.ListItem(&quot;Item &quot; + i));
}

list.addListener(&quot;mouseover&quot;, function(e) {
  console.log(&quot;mouseover&quot;, e.getTarget().classname);
});
list.addListener(&quot;mouseout&quot;, function(e) {
  console.log(&quot;mouseout&quot;, e.getTarget().classname);
});



I will talk to the team and figure out what the expected behavior is and how we can achieve that.</thetext>

            <thetext>After talking to the team, we decided that this is the way it should be. Not that we think that this is a intuitive behavior but as these events have the same name as their native events, we decided that the behavior should also map to the native behavior. See the following native sample:

There are two events which would do what you expected: mouseenter and mouseleave. I added a enhancement bug to support these events: Bug #7461</thetext>
