            <thetext>Log entries (e.g. with &#39;this.debug()&#39;) issued during run time of Playground 
code are not immediately visible in the Log window. (They become visible when 
the &quot;Run&quot; button is executed the next time). Make the Log window update in 
real-time, or provide an &quot;Update&quot; button so it can be updated on user request.

Try the Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V keys from the attached Playground URL on its table.</thetext>

            <thetext>The current implementation of the log in the playground is not keeping the appender registered. Keeping that should enable the live update as well.

&gt; With what revision will the fix be available?

Revision 22657. 

Also, if I remember correctly, other applications have the same Log window that should behave like these one (by having a Clear button and be updated in real-time). Should we try to be DRY and abstract these into some type of &quot;component&quot; that can be used by the other applications?</thetext>

+1 for the common log window. We could start this as a contrib, in &#39;components&#39;, or just as a name space within an app like Playground. Other apps like Testrunner could use it from there. I&#39;m very much in favour of adding component libraries to our standard apps, to get our fingers dirty with this kind of things as our users are facing the same issues.

Adi, could you add a note which other apps besides Playground could benefit from a log window component?!</thetext>

There are 2 more applications that uses a Log window: DemoBrowser and TestRunner.</thetext>

            <thetext>Reducing the amount of duplicated code is always a good idea. Adrian, could you open up a bug report for that? Include the ideas of Thomas to put it into the contrib because that sounds like a good place to start.</thetext>
