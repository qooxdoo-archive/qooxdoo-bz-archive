            <thetext>The component/testrunner/portable.json uses a job definition (&quot;gen-css&quot;) that contains non-portable shell commands &#39;cat&#39; and &#39;sed&#39;. These tools are not available under Windows and introduce additional installation prerequisites for uses working on that platform. This violates our &quot;Python-only&quot; prerequisites effort; we should be careful not to violate it without dire need.

In that sense should the &#39;cat&#39; and &#39;sed&#39; commands be replaced by commands that are available cross-platform and don&#39;t extend our list of prerequisites. A tool/bin/cat.py has already been written for this purpose. The &#39;sed&#39; command can probably be replaced by another suitable Python script, maybe in testrunner/tool if it is not generic enough.</thetext>

            <thetext>The portable Test Runner is not intended to be generated by SDK users. It is a pre-built library like qx-oo that can be downloaded from qooxdoo.org.

I would rather move portable.json to some place where it won&#39;t be included in the SDK than invest any amount of time in making it cross-platform.</thetext>

Thats a good question. Is there really no need to someone to build that on its own, maybe with a slightly different configuration?</thetext>

            <thetext>All right, you&#39;ve convinced me. Replaced the sed command with a cross-platform Python script, tool/injectcss.py
