            <thetext>Hello,

Overwriting of “private” members was forbidden in version 0.7.3. As a result patch for “private” member (method) cannot be made. The problem in the line #1293 of qx.Class. I suppose it should look like:

if (patch !== true &amp;&amp; proto[key] !== undefined &amp;&amp; key.charAt(0) == &quot;_&quot; &amp;&amp; key.charAt(1) == &quot;_&quot;) {

Best regards,
Denis</thetext>

            <thetext>Patching privates is not a good idea at all and should not allowed in my opinion. The private optimizer, which has a good impact on the final size of delivered JS, also break this.</thetext>

            <thetext>Sometimes it is very useful to have this option.
I suppose “private patching” should not be forbidden if this option does not lead to overheads.

            <thetext>It leads to overhead in some way because it do not allow to enable the private 
optimizer anymore. This especially means a bigger compiled file for the 
application.

Please keep in mind that private methods are often called by protected or even 
public methods, so it may be better to patch them instead of the private method 
(in other frameworks private members are often hidden in closures and not 
visible to outside at all).</thetext>
