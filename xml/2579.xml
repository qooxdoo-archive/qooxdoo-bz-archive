            <thetext>The event sequence for the contextmenu event is wrong. The expected sequence is:

down -&gt; up -&gt; contextmenu


In Firefox 3.0/3.5 we get

down -&gt; contextmenu -&gt; up


in Safari 4 we get

down -&gt; down -&gt; up -&gt; contextmenu -&gt; up
This is a regression because Safari now fires events correctly but we still have a 
workaround in place.


Opera 10:

no support for &quot;contextmenu&quot; at all (tested on OSX


Opera 9.6

emulated contextmenu event works ok but there is no way to prevent the default browser
menu</thetext>

            <thetext>I&#39;m no longer sure if down -&gt; up -&gt; contextmenu is really the correct event sequence.

FF and Safari have down -&gt; contextmenu -&gt; up and this is consistent with the way they
show the context menu. The context menu is opened on mouse down. If the mouse button
is released the context menu is already open. </thetext>

            <thetext>This is a platform issue. Windows opens context menus on mouseup, while OSX opens them on mousedown. This is reflected in the event sequence. All tests above (except IE) have been performed under OSX. On windows FF shows the same behaviour as IE.</thetext>

            <thetext>After some experiments it seems like it is not possible to reorder the events without 
doing more harm than good.

If we want to reorder the OSX sequence down -&gt; contextmenu -&gt; up to the windows
sequence down -&gt; up -&gt; contextmenu we have two possibilities:

1. Drop the contextmenu event and fire a synthetic contextmenu event on mouseup for 
the right mouse button: This is problematic because in this scenario it is not possible to
handle &quot;preventDefault&quot; for the contextmenu. Further the mouseup is not even fired
in Safari if preventDefault has not been called on the &quot;contextmenu&quot; event.

2. Drop the mouseup event and fire a synthetic mouseup event just before the
contextmenu event. This is problematic because now the mouseup event is fired before
the mouse button has actually been released by the user.

Rather than normalizing the event sequences between the different platforms I would 
keep the native sequence and make sure the framework handles both sequences gracefully.
After all those sequences correspond to the actual platform behaviour.</thetext>
