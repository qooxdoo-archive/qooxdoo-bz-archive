            <thetext>There is no way to remove already added form widgets. If I want to build a dynamic form (add and remove widgets while keeping other items) I have to remove the form and rebuild it.

Please add a remove() method to qx.ui.form.Form and qx.ui.mobile.form.Form which removes the given widget from the form (Like the other remove() methods).</thetext>

            <thetext>I can add a remove method to the form but that does not remove the widget from the already rendered instances. The form itself does not know its renderer so with the current architecture, removing the widget from the rendered instance is not possible. But you could create another renderer and use that one. Would that help?</thetext>

            <thetext>And what about implementing a remove feature to the qx form renderers?</thetext>

            <thetext>I just talked to Daniel about a proper solution and I think we do have a good one.

1. The form emits an event as soon as anything changes in its structure. All renderer can listen to that event and update immediately.

2. We add remove methods to the form to make it possible to remove items from the form.

Those two things combined allow to use the form in a dynamic context either you add or remove widgets after the rendering process.

What do you think of that? Would that fit your needs / help you?</thetext>

            <thetext>I liked the idea so much that I could not resist. ;)
