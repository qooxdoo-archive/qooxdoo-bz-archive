            <thetext>The issue is best described by a use case, one that I followed myself. 

1) qooxdoo twitter account posts status: https://twitter.com/#!/qooxdoo/status/58081964229529600

2) Follow the link in the tweet to the API docs http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/#qx.dev.unit.MMock

3) Notice that there is no way to see if the qx.dev.unit.MMock class is available to version 1.3.x of the framework


There is a workaround by replacing the /current/ part of the URL to /1.3.x/ , which in the case above shows an alert message &quot;Unknown class: qx.dev.unit.MMock&quot;

This would be a great addition to the already great API viewer application. For an example of what I am talking about you can see in any of the Qt Class documentation what version the class was introduced in. 

for a random example see : http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qabstractxmlreceiver.html 

&quot;This class was introduced in Qt 4.4.&quot;</thetext>

            <thetext>Thomas, do you have an idea how we could get something like that automatically? It much work to get every class updated we already have.</thetext>

            <thetext>We could scan the SVN logs for &quot;added&quot; entries, and then match the corresponding revision numbers to releases.

- But we should carefully consider how this information shall be applied.
- We had cases where classes were moved/renamed. What would be their &quot;added&quot; status?!
- There is the righteous question if the same tagging should be applied to methods. But would that be overkill?!
- How should we go about future new classes?
  - We could add a @versionadded JSDoc tag, which has to be present with every class (which could be enforced by the apidoc generation process).
  - As we are not adding new classes every other day, I guess this would be an acceptable burden for API doc writers.</thetext>
