            <thetext>The desktop Apiviewer has a &quot;Legend&quot; tab that explains the images used in the 
class documentation and Apiviewer tree. Besides the icons for package, class, 
method etc. there is a set of indicators used with these icons, like &quot;static&quot;, 
&quot;abstract&quot; or &quot;singleton&quot;. These indicators are documented inconsistently. Some 
of them are documented at the bottom of the page (which is nice and generic), 
others are documented with concrete icons, which leads to multiple ways to do 
the same thing, and sometimes even to duplication (e.g. with [upper S] for 
static). 

I suggest removing all icons with attached indicators and documenting the 
individual indicators together at the bottom of the legend, e.g. like this:

[upper S]  Entry (class/method/...) is static

[upper A]  Entry (class/method/...) is abstract

[upper 1]   Class is singleton

[pencil]  Property is themeable

[warning sign]      Entry (package/class/ ...)  is not fully documented

[x]   Attribute (method/property/...) is not fully documented

[green arrow] Attribute (method/property/...) is included from a mixin

[arrow up]  Attribute (method/property/...) is inherited

[triangle]  Attribute (method/property/...) overrides inherited attribute.</thetext>
