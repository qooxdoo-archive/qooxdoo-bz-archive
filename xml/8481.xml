            <thetext>To reproduce:

Scroll up ad down very fast untill the scroller breaks.
The reason is that pointerdown event is not more firering on the scroller element
It has been remove nowhere.</thetext>

            <thetext>Reproduced with a demo app that registers several pointer* listeners. The pointerdown listener is never removed, but some of the others are removed multiple times each (which fails silently as expected).
This exposed a problem in module.event.PointerHandler, which uses a simple counter to keep track of the number of pointer listeners attached to an element and disposes the PointerHandler when the last one is removed. If the calling code tries to remove the same listener twice, the counter is decremented by two, which can lead to the Handler getting disposed even though there are still some listeners left. I replaced this naive implementation with one that checks the emitter&#39;s listener registry, which should be reliable.
