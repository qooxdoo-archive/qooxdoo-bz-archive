            <thetext>Currently, the text search functionality of the manual has some drawbacks, that render it almost impractical for typical use. For instance,

* Uppercase words are not found, e.g. &quot;FILENAME&quot; isn&#39;t, but &quot;filename&quot; is. This seems to be true for all words that start with at least 4 uppercase characters (.e. &quot;FILename&quot; works).
  ==&gt; it would make sense to find all words independent of upper-/lowercase

* Search terms that include a hyphen cannot be found, e.g. &quot;watch-files&quot;.
  ==&gt; as those terms are important (as in Generator keys) they should be included with the index

* Similar to hyphens, search terms with dots cannot be found, e.g. &quot;qx.util.ColorUtil&quot;
  ==&gt; as those terms are important (as in class names) they should be included with the index

More limitations might become apparent when looking into the index generation and search handling.</thetext>

* Uppercase words

This seems to be a sphinx bug. I&#39;ve added a comment with all the details to the relevant issue on their issue tracker [1]. For now we just lowercase every search word to fit the search term index, which only contains lower case words.

* hyphens and dots

This limitation was due to the word regex during index feeding. I&#39;ve added &quot;.&quot; and &quot;-&quot; as permitted characters.

Both fixes/patches could be integrated within our theme or config files (&quot;conf.py&quot;), which ensures that everyone with a qooxdoo checkout benefits from the better search index without having to patch his/her sphinx installation.

My initial concerns with a too bloated search index file were ungrounded.

            <thetext>The hyphen/dot issues is now also fixed within the already released manuals of v2.0, v2.0.1, v2.0.2, v2.0.3, v2.0.4, v.2.1 and v2.1.1.

The uppercase issue is fixed within the upcoming v3.0 and v2.1.2 only, because it requires not merely a change of a single file (searchindex.js) but every manual page.</thetext>

How is that? I thought that could be fixed through a theme file?!</thetext>

            <thetext>@Richard, could you also add @ to the allowed chars of the index, please. Guess that would make sense for the meta infos like @ignore. 

For the time being it could also be helpful to allow for # chars to cover the (now deprecated) older meta info syntax in previous manuals?</thetext>
