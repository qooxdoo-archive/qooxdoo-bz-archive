            <thetext>Add a translation demo to demobrowser. The demo should exercise features of our 
translation system:

- feedreader-like switching between locales
- simple translations msgid - msgstr
- plural translations, with msgid_plural and msgstr_plural[..]
- po comments through code
- all interface functions tr, trn, trc, ...</thetext>

            <thetext>Not much changed compared to my prototype.

- Although the code is a good enough example of how to use the most frequent translation functions, it could have used more of the API (qx.locale.Manager.addLocale, addTranslation, ...), to demonstrate its usage.

- The GUI of the demo is not very clear, it lacks additional hints, maybe a short descriptive text, what the controls do and how to interpret the outcome.

- Change of locale doesn&#39;t trigger change of the displayed translated strings, which I would expect.

- The territory locales (de_DE, en_US, fr_FR) don&#39;t show any difference towards the their main locale (de, en, fr), which somewhat misses the point.

- The translated strings column could use a &quot;Clear&quot; button to clear the fields.

I wonder whether it will be of big help for someone looking for a good overview of what the qooxdoo translation API has to offer (which was the intend of this bug). Oh well...</thetext>

well, the prototype covered most functions.
&gt; - Although the code is a good enough example of how to use the most frequent
&gt; translation functions, it could have used more of the API
&gt; (qx.locale.Manager.addLocale, addTranslation, ...), to demonstrate its usage.

I looked at qx.locale.Manager, but I thought those methods are more suited for the localization demo and not here at translation. 

&gt; - The GUI of the demo is not very clear, it lacks additional hints, maybe a
&gt; short descriptive text, what the controls do and how to interpret the outcome.

i will add a short descriptive text, sure.

&gt; - Change of locale doesn&#39;t trigger change of the displayed translated strings,
&gt; which I would expect.
no, one has to click on the buttons.

Well, watching the js source one can see how to use tr function for example, but i guess the initial steps with &quot;./generate.py translate&quot; and modifying the .po files, that cannot be demoed in the browser could be written as an intro.
but we have the manual page for that too, so only a link would suffice in that regard.</thetext>

&gt; &gt; Not much changed compared to my prototype.
&gt; well, the prototype covered most functions.

But it looked ugly and was not intuitive.

&gt; &gt; - Although the code is a good enough example of how to use the most frequent
&gt; &gt; translation functions, it could have used more of the API
&gt; &gt; (qx.locale.Manager.addLocale, addTranslation, ...), to demonstrate its 
usage.
&gt; 
&gt; I looked at qx.locale.Manager, but I thought those methods are more suited 
for the localization demo and not here at translation. 

No, because they concern translation just as well, and if you look at the 
localization demo, that doesn&#39;t use qx.local.Manager.add* at all.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - The GUI of the demo is not very clear, it lacks additional hints, maybe a
&gt; &gt; short descriptive text, what the controls do and how to interpret the 
outcome.
&gt; 
&gt; i will add a short descriptive text, sure.

It&#39;s not just the text.

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - Change of locale doesn&#39;t trigger change of the displayed translated 
strings,
&gt; &gt; which I would expect.
&gt; no, one has to click on the buttons.

Yeah, I discovered that. But is it good?!

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; - The territory locales (de_DE, en_US, fr_FR) don&#39;t show any difference 
towards
&gt; &gt; the their main locale (de, en, fr), which somewhat misses the point.

Great.

&gt; &gt; - The translated strings column could use a &quot;Clear&quot; button to clear the 
fields.
&gt; sure.

but we have the manual page for that too, so only a link would suffice in that 
regard.

That&#39;s right, we cannot demo .po file handling. But the demo could hint at 
generate.py translation/existing .po file entries (if only in code comments), 
but could also show dynamic additon of keys and translations.</thetext>

            <thetext>I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m, again, not satisfied. Here are my remarks which should be fixed:

- If there are headlines for the two lower sections, there has to be a headline for the first section too.
- Underlines for strings are often seen as links. Maybe bold text would here be better.
- On startup, the labels are not visiable which leads to some stranke looking UI (only a selectbox containing a number)
- The select box should have a label, not only a tooltip showing its purpose
- The same is true for the strings, the english or base string would be good here. Maybe align them vertically and put the english stuff in the first row and the description how to use it in some other row.
- The whole layout flickers when the locale is changed from a two character locale to a 5 character locale due to the fact of the locale in the add description. That should not happen.
- The translated string right next to the &quot;show Translation&quot; button. Its not really clear that this thing changes and reflects the state of the translation.</thetext>
