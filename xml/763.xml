            <thetext>There is a recommendation is that object instances are cached.

I&#39;ve been working on this for our application and have hit two problems
with our handlers.

Each handler has a widget that displays it. This might be a splitter, or
just a html window.

There is a viewer object which creates (or re-uses) and manages
appropriate handlers. This is based on qx.ui.layout.HorizontalBoxLayout
and add() is called on the widget created for the handler.

Now that the handler is not disposed, but is re-used, the old widget from
it is added to the viewer and then widget.show() is called.

However, the HorizontalBoxLayout isn&#39;t laying out a child which is re-used.
If I show one handler, then select another one, then resize the
application and show the first handler again (re-using the original
instance) then the first handler is shown at its original size until I
resize the browser window. 

To work around thisI&#39;ve had to artificially change minWidth and minHeight on the re-used widget. This forces a relayout.

            <thetext>These issues should be gone in 0.8. Don&#39;t think we have a chance to improve the 
situation for 0.7.x though.</thetext>
