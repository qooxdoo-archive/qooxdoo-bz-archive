            <thetext>Observed with Opera 10.63/Mac.

qx.test.ui.Destroy:testEmbeds
Error message is: 
Disposing qx.ui.embed.Iframe: The object &#39;qx.ui.core.EventHandler&#39; has not been disposed!: Expected value not to be undefined but found !

Curiously, this test does not fail with the debugging console switched on. Also, this issue seems to be limited to Opera 10.6. It does not appear in Opera 10.10.</thetext>

            <thetext>The offending assertion is:

this.assertNotUndefined(
  regCopy[key],
  msg + &quot;: The object &#39;&quot; + obj.classname + &quot;&#39; has not been disposed!&quot;
);

found in qx.test.ui.LayoutTestCase#assertDestroy.

#assertDestroy runs a function given by the test that creates and destroys widgets; in this case including a qx.ui.embed.Iframe. After that function is run, a copy of the object registry is made and the function given is called again.

The assertion pasted above expects that the object registry contains only objects that were in the object registry cloned *before* the function given was called the second time. In other words, it detects an increase in object counts.

(The registry is iterated, and each key is looked up in the cloned registry. When regCopy[key] is undefined, reg contains an object that is not present in regCopy)</thetext>
