            <thetext>Run your Application

Now that your application is setup, lets generate a version that can be opened in your browser. Move to the newly created application directory and kick off the automatic build process:

cd C:/custom
generate.py source-all

Under non-Windows systems you might have to prefix the command with the local directory, i.e. execute ./generate.py source-all instead.</thetext>

            <thetext>What&#39;s the issue of this bug? What is the relation between the bug summary and 
the bug description (Just quoting a section from the manual doesn&#39;t help much)? 
What were you trying to do and which issue did you encounter? If generate.py 
does not exist in your new application, what else does? Did you get any errors 
from running create-application.py? What were the command line arguments to it?</thetext>

&quot;According to the documention (the part I quoted) I am supposed to run the

which does exist
is called &#39;generator.py&#39; which does what the documentation describes.  The
bug is that the

No, it does not in the SDK itself. But prior to running generate.py, the manual page instructs you to run another command, create-application.py, which you obviously skipped (s. the section &quot;Create your Application&quot; on the same page). And running create-application.py will *create* generate.py, among other things, in the newly created application folder (called &quot;custom&quot; in the manual example).

Run the create-application.py command, and you will find things as expected.</thetext>

&quot;Thanks for the correction.  I did run create-application.py but since I did not have it in my path it did not find the generate.py file.  When it could not find the file I looked at the SDK bin since it was in my path and found the generator.py file instead.  When I ran generator.py it built my application and I was able to launch my &#39;Hello World&#39; app in my browser.&quot;</thetext>
