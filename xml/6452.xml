            <thetext>For a better research on search engines, we should think about a &quot;facade&quot; for our website content.

Every indexed site should be pointed to one path, the current version.

Force http://manual.qooxdoo.org/current/
Deny http://manual.qooxdoo.org/1.2.2/

Better research for users will be the afford. For deprecated old manual page we could always leave the last version but with a hint to the guilty version.


The api viewer app can be index by google as well. So just using of #! is needed. 
Example: http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/apiviewer/#!qx.bom.element.Dataset
This page could index by google. Same as on website / manual, just allow google to index one path.</thetext>

That means we should only offer a link to current and thats it? Remove all links to the versions?

We already use the # for the classes and methods. Is the #! required by google?</thetext>

The hash-bang lets Google know that the page content has been updated by an AJAX call.

We will also need to make sure Google finds the hash-bang links. Since we don&#39;t use link elements in the API Viewer GUI, we could generate an XML sitemap along with the JSON API data.</thetext>

            <thetext>Added a &quot;sitemap&quot; sub-key to the &quot;api&quot; job key. The &quot;api-verify&quot; job in the framework uses this to create framework/api/sitemap.xml (with 639c01e4 on master).</thetext>
