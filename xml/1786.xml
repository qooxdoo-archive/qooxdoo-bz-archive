            <thetext>Why implement this in qx.ui.embed.Html and not qx.ui.core.Widget? I would say this is a more general issue. And why at all does the current handling in qx.event.handler.Focus does not work to omit selection here? Questions over questions ;)

Would be nice to have some more background info in these reports instead of just &quot;fixed&quot;. </thetext>

            <thetext>Had a look at the code at qx.event.handler.Focus (lines 865-875).

Normally webkit should stop the &quot;mousedown&quot; event (preventDefault) for cases where the underlying widget is not focusable. Just wondering why this does not work in the case of HTML widgets. It would be better to have some investigation here why this work for A and not for B instead of just patching around in some widget and add some additional code block which may not be necessary.

There seems to be an error in &quot;__onNativeSelectStart&quot; in the same class where even in the webkit branch &quot;e.srcElement&quot; is used. Maybe fixing this method also fixes this bug. Not tested it though.

Reopen bug to allow to have another look at these issues.</thetext>

            <thetext>If you allow the container element to be selectable for all widgets, some widgets (e.g. text fields) get an ugly blue background. In my oppinion it is better to just set the container and content element selectable for widgets which have content that should be selectable.

This can not be handled by the focus handler since the handler checks DOM elements for the attribute &quot;qxSelectable&quot; and the CSS attribute &quot;-webkit-user-select&quot; is handled by the browser.</thetext>

            <thetext>Sebastian, please note that a text selection can also be created by using keyboard shortcuts like cmd + a or from the &quot;Edit&quot; menu. Preventing the mouse down event is not enough, we need to work with the native user-selection handling of the browser.</thetext>

            <thetext>This still do not answer why implementing this in this class and not as part of qx.ui.core.Widget.

One issue with these CSS properties is that in some browsers (not remember exactly) the inheritance override do not work correctly e.g.:

- widget 1 (selectable: false)
  - widget 2 (selectable: true)
    - widget 3 (selectable: false)

Are you sure that these cases now work correctly? This was the original reason why we do not use this code as part of qx.ui.core.Widget as normally the outer elements are not selectable, but some inner elements are and in Safari or Gecko (not sure) this was no solvable with these native properties. 

Sorry for being a bit nervous here, but please just double / triple check your changes for such use cases. This code is highly critical and somewhat buggy browser implementations mean that not the 100% logical way does work as indented. At least a half year ago there where a lot of major issues when applying these CSS properties. 

What&#39;s about the issue in &quot;__onNativeSelectStart&quot;. Can you have a look at this one?

I do not think that shortcuts (Ctrl+A) are a large issue as this property is normally not used for such things like pseudo securing the content on the page but for behavior reasons of a single element in a large application. We never have respected this before and this would be a new requirement. To have such a new feature in a already quite complex code is not easy and should be tested well. Still not sure if there is a need for something like this though.

Just another small note: Omitting selections also blocks the option to have a caret in text fields in some browsers so all kind of text inputs will not work anymore when applying a global &quot;user-select:false&quot;.</thetext>

            <thetext>I will check __onNativeSelectStart() and try to find a solution for cascaded wigets with different &quot;user-select&quot; properties. At the moment this will not work in Webkit.</thetext>
