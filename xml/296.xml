            <thetext>If you click on a link in the API viewer that takes you to another class, that class is loaded on the right hand side. In addition the tree node is selected.

However, if the node was not displayed because the parent wasn&#39;t expanded, then you can&#39;t tell where the node is in the tree. As an example, click on the URL I&#39;ve provided, then click on qx.core.Object. You can&#39;t tell where you are in the tree. Now, expand qx.core in the tree, go back to qx.type.Range, and click on qx.core.Object again - you will see it selected in the tree.

I had to implement code to automatically open a selected node in the tree in our product - it goes something like this:

   //
   // Find all parent folders
   //
   var oTreeFolder = treeNode;
   var loParentFolders = [];                    // need to open folders in sequence from root
   while (oTreeFolder)                          // while we haven&#39;t gone off the top
      {
      oTreeFolder = oTreeFolder.getParentFolder(); // get parent
      loParentFolders.push(oTreeFolder);        // remember parent
      };
   //
   // Now open all folders, starting at the top
   //
   loParentFolders.pop();                       // pop empty folder at end
   while (loParentFolders.length)               // while we have some parents
      {
      loParentFolders.pop().open();             // get last one, and open it.
      };

This would be needed in apiviewer.Viewer.showClassNyName before the call to 

treeNode.setSelected(true)

Maybe it would be better to add this to TreeFolder as a new API - something like &quot;ensureVisible&quot;. See bug 294.

            <thetext>I have applied your patch to the API viewer. Maybe we should move this code to the tree class and make this behaviour the default for tree node selection.</thetext>

            <thetext>The implementation has been moved to the tree selection manager and is now part of the framework.</thetext>
