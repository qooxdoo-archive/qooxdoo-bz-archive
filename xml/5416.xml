            <thetext>There is currently no integrated solution within the framework to easily create a dialog panel as one can do with the Dialog contribution.
It would be a great thing to implement an equivalent.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report. But why should we add an equivalent if there is already a solution in the contrib? Is something wrong with that or is it just the fact that it&#39;s not in the framework itself?</thetext>

            <thetext>As you can read it in the mailing-list, the developer of this contribution himself would like to see such an integration.
Furthermore, this contribution is a fast developed and dirty implementation (not themable, not L10N support).</thetext>

            <thetext>So but that would in the end not be an equivalent of the code base, more of the feature set. Now I agree and we should think about adding such dialogs.</thetext>

&gt; So but that would in the end not be an equivalent of the code base, more of the
&gt; feature set. Now I agree and we should think about adding such dialogs.

Yes, the feature needs be developed from scratch. My code base is basically a fast hack. It works, but is not exactly a model of how qooxdoo code should look like.</thetext>

            <thetext>Chrome 31+ implements the WHATWG &lt;dialog&gt; element [1][2] and there is also a polyfill [3] available. Currently the feature (see demo page[3]) is hidden behind a flag and no other browser supports it, but this could be the way to go sometime in the future.
