            <thetext>Alexander Steitz suggested me to ask adding searching facility for table contents (as an enhancement). It would be nice to be able to use the built-in searching facility of the web browser (CTRL-F3 in most browsers), but currently this is not working in Chrome or Firefox. It seems this is not working at all in any browsers (I tested all examples in http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/demobrowser/# -&gt; Demos -&gt; table).

Is this feature planned to be implemented in qx? I guess this would be a great feature.

(Any suggestions, please, on how to start to implement it? Thanks!)</thetext>

            <thetext>That is in general a good idea and should work. But with one restriction. The table widget is, like the new widgets we recently added, virtual, which means only the visible elements are in the DOM. Keeping that in mind, it should be obvious that the search of the browser, which checks whats visible on the page, can only check stuff which is currently rendered. It will not find rows of the table which are not currently on the screen.</thetext>
