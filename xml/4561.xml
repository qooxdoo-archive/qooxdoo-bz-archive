            <thetext>One case where this becomes aparent are silencing acknowledged warnings.

In bug#5647, the generator complains about variables being used in calls to 
qx.core.Environment in qx.dev.unit.MRequirements. In this class, this is known 
and deliberately so. The first approach is to define a config key, to silence 
this particular kind of warnings 
(config-warnings/environment/non-literal-keys). But this approach has two 
disadvantages:

- It silences *all* warnings of this kind in the particular job, and not only 
for qx.dev.unit.MRequirements, where they are checked.  There might be other 
classes in the build, where using a variable is actually unintentional, and 
leads to missing check classes in the final script.

- It silences all warnings of this kind *only* in the particular job. If the 
users uses MRequirements in another job, pot. not derived from &#39;test&#39; etc., the 
config key is not in place and the warning will creep up again.

What you actually want is to check off the warning in the specific class, 
MRequirements, directly (and maybe even only for a certain method), so this 
check will be available wherever this class is used, and only for this class. 
The mechanism we have for this are the @lint ignore* JSDoc hints which are used 
in the ecmalint tool, and this would be the appropriate approach for the 
generator also.</thetext>

            <thetext>In the course of working on bug#4615 a common lint module has been brought into 
the generator. Both the lint and the compile jobs use it (albeit with slightly 
different configurations). Hence, warnings are unique.

At the same time, the new lint module evaluates @ hints in JSDoc comments, so 
there is also a single approach to check off certain warnings in the actual 
code where the offense takes place. This fulfills the second intention of this 
bug.</thetext>
