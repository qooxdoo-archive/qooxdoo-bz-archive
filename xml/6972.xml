            <thetext>MenuButton put on a popup opens its menu with smaller zIndex which leads it to be positioned under popup.</thetext>

            <thetext>I think this is by design. I check how the zIndex is calculated for popup like widgets and found the following numbers.

windows have zIndex starting with 1e5
menus have zIndex starting with 1e6
popups have zIndex starting with 1e7

So there is a hierarchy designed in the code that a window is always below a menu and a menu is always below a popup.
I mark the bug as &#39;worksforme&#39; as this is by design and a restriction we can life with. As you already wrote in your sample code, it can be easily worked around and thats what I suggest to do.</thetext>

            <thetext>I can&#39;t agree this is something that can be called &quot;by design&quot;. The design doesn&#39;t expect all cases the can be produced with the API. In particular, a menu opened from a popup, which results in the flaw. In case of the example it is actually broken by design, so WORKSFORME is kind of strange resolution.

Leaving this as-is is unintuitive because legit API calls should not result in broken UI. So WONTFIX isn&#39;t a good idea as well (however better than WORKSFORME).

What I suggest is to turn it into enhancement where zIndex values will be calculated correctly during widget hierarchy construction (add, _add) or tuned at render phase or on appear, considering parent&#39;s value. So some day it could be universally correct and for now we can live with the workaround.</thetext>

            <thetext>I agree that we would leave the bug open to give it a chance to get fixed later on.</thetext>
