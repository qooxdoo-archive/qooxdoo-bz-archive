            <thetext>The Demo Browser has several major flaws:
* It&#39;s entirely RIA-focused while we&#39;re trying to expand the scope of the framework into the mobile and website domains
* Doesn&#39;t run on mobile devices
* Contains several demos that are really tests
* Is more likely to be used as a snippet repository, a use case it doesn&#39;t properly support
* Historically grown code that is very hard to maintain/extend
* Has unnecessary controls (Debug menu)
* Takes very long to generate since every demo is a stand-alone application
* &quot;To Playground&quot; is useful but doesn&#39;t work with multi-class demos
* Categories are outdated/hard to understand
* Tagging mechanism not properly reflected in the GUI
* Contains redundant demos (&quot;showcase&quot; category)</thetext>
