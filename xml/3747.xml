            <thetext>Consider the following code:

  var form = new qx.ui.form.Form();
  var field = new qx.ui.form.TextField();
  form.add( field, &quot;Hello &amp; Goodbye&quot; );

When commited:

  var o = qx.util.Serializer.toNativeObject( this.e_controller.createModel() );


This causes a javascript error:

Uncaught ReferenceError: Goodbye is not defined

This only happens when there is an ampersand in the field name.


Thanks very much for Qooxdoo - bloody marvelous toolkit!!</thetext>

            <thetext>Hey Matt,
thanks for your kind words and the bug report. Unfortunately, thats something we can not fix because ampersands can not be used in JavaScript properties:

{a&amp;b : &quot;test&quot;}

This will cause an error. Using an ampersand in the label will exactly cause that error because the createModel method will convert the data in the form into a qooxdo object having all form values as property. 
But on the other hand, using one in the label should not be a problem. Thats where the name comes in (fourth parameter for the add method). Using this as a deputy for the label excluding the ampersand fixes this issue:

form.add( field, &quot;Hello &amp; Goodbye&quot;, null, &quot;someOtherName&quot; );

In this example, the data will appear as &quot;someOtherName&quot; in the serialized model.
Does that fix your issue?
Regards,
Martin</thetext>

Martin, is there some reason that it couldn&#39;t have mapped to an object using quotes? If so, the problem would be solved:

{&quot;a&amp;b&quot; : &quot;test&quot;}

is perfectly legal.

&gt; Martin, is there some reason that it couldn&#39;t have mapped to an object using
&gt; quotes? If so, the problem would be solved:

Sure, that would solve the problem but would lead to another problem. The &quot;createModel&quot; method creates a qooxdoo class and an instance of it on runtime. Every label is represented by a property in the model. If you want to access the property, you use 

instance.getA&amp;b();

which is not working in the case of having &amp; in the label. Sure you can still access the getter using quotes but thats not really something I like to see in qooxdoo code:

instance[&quot;getA&amp;b&quot;]();

So this is not a problem of form or data binding, it&#39;s a problem of creating classes having properties with not allowed characters.</thetext>

            <thetext>I just added a regexp to remove the following characters which cause the problem.

&amp; - + * / | ! space
