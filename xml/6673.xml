            <thetext>The data-binding features of qooxdoo are really great,
and so are the widgets using them, especially qx.ui.list.List.

Perhaps I haven&#39;t found it yet, but it seems that there is a lack
of documentation about creating custom widgets with &quot;native&quot; data 
awareness capabilities. In fact, documentation for creation of
custom widgets (which extends qx.ui.core.Widget) with features such
as selection management, child management, virtual widgets, etc might
be very helpful (I know that they are implemented through Mixins, but they
are usually designated as &#39;internal&#39; and I didn&#39;t find any explanation
as to how to use them).

Thanks, and thank you for the great framework!
