            <thetext>The manual has a page which lists framework jobs [1]. I would either see it deleted or completed (but then we&#39;ll soon have the same situation with missing jobs). 

CLI output
----------
In this regard the CLI output of &quot;framework/generate.py&quot; should be completed too and maybe it&#39;s over the top but an automatic check for undocumented jobs would be great too.

            <thetext>&gt; The manual has a page which lists framework jobs [1]. I would either see it
&gt; deleted or completed (but then we&#39;ll soon have the same situation with missing
&gt; jobs). 

Which situation are you referring to? That we add jobs to config.json that are
not listed in the manual?

Generally, I have no problem with dropping the page. The Generator listing is
more important, and as the job information is mainly for us and the page doesn&#39;t
contain much beyond the console output or descriptions of default jobs, we can
get away without it.

What do you mean with &quot;completed&quot;? Add more jobs to the export list? Or add
documentation strings to the ones that are already in it?

First of all the listing should show all jobs that can sensibly be run in the
framework. I agree it would be nice if all had a proper &#39;desc&#39; attribute. But
the main thing is the export list, itself which is (should be) properly
maintained, and I wouldn&#39;t want one of those jobs be filtered on the grounds
that it has no desc.

Besides this, there are naturally jobs in the framework&#39;s config.json that are
deliberately *not* in the export list, but I guess you are not concerned about
those.</thetext>

            <thetext>&gt; Which situation are you referring to? That we add jobs to config.json that are
not listed in the manual?

Yes, exactly. It raises the question if the missing ones are somewhat &quot;more internal&quot; or if somebody just has forgotten to add them. Dropping the page is also my preferred solution because like you I think the Generator listing is more important.

&gt; What do you mean with &quot;completed&quot;? Add more jobs to the export list? Or add
documentation strings to the ones that are already in it?

I meant the documentation strings only (i.e. all having &quot;a proper &#39;desc&#39; attribute&quot;).</thetext>
