            <thetext>Hi there

Seems that setTextSelection doesn&#39;t work when it is used within an input event (on Webkit).

Test Case:
http://tinyurl.com/3jgnzq9

The thing is, that the &quot;textSelection&quot; is modified by Webkit itself on an input event:
1-Select the introduced character
2-Execute our event
3-Move the cared to the last position

The behavior can be shown at:
http://tinyurl.com/5sysl8n

So, with that information I figure out the next workaround:

The workaround has been tested on:
chromium: 10.0.648.205 (81283)
qt-webkit: 1.2

Cheers.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the high quality report!

@Alex: Could you check that?</thetext>

            <thetext>Verified.

Here are my findings when using the http://tinyurl.com/5sysl8n URL to test. The text below describe the behaviour of the browsers when entering a character in the text field.

== Firefox 4 ==

1. First &#39;alert&#39; appears
2. Second &#39;alert&#39; appears
3. Text selection get visible and is active


== Opera 11.10 ==

1. First &#39;alert&#39; appears
2. Text selection gets visible, but inactive
3. Second &#39;alert&#39; appears
4. Text selection is active


== IE 9 ==

1. First &#39;alert&#39; appears
2. Second &#39;alert&#39; appears
3. Text selection get visible and is active


== Chrome 10 / Chromium 12 ==

1. Typed character gets selected and active
2. First &#39;alert&#39; appears
3. Text selection get visible and active
4. Second &#39;alert&#39; appears
5. Caret is moved after the typed in character and former text selection is lost


== Safari 5 == 

1. First &#39;alert&#39; appears
2. Text selection get visible and active
3. Second &#39;alert&#39; appears
4. Caret is moved after the typed in character and former text selection is lost


So we probably should normalize this behaviour here. The desired result should be that the text selection is visible and active at the end.</thetext>
