            <thetext>As stated in MDC [1], Firefox 3.1 will be out as 3.5. That means that qooxdoo Bugzilla also needs some love in accordance. :-)


The intuitive steps should be fairly simple (I&#39;m not a Bugzilla expert, though this list of actions sounds reasonable):
1. Move all &quot;Firefox 3.1&quot; platform bugs [2] to &quot;Firefox 3.5&quot;;
2. Create platform &quot;Firefox 3.6&quot;;
3. Move all &quot;Firefox 3.2&quot; platform bugs [3] (none as of this writing) to &quot;Firefox 3.6&quot;;
4. Remove platforms &quot;Firefox 3.1&quot; and &quot;Firefox 3.2&quot;;

Steps 1 and 3 can be done by anyone with bug edit privileges (I&#39;ll try to do step 1 ASAP, step 3 is currently not needed), but the other remaining steps must be done by someone with (Bugzilla) administration privileges. ;-)

The Bugzilla queries [2] [3] can also be used as a quick way to check for hanging bugs before actually removing the platform entries (although I bet Bugzilla complains if something would break from such a change). :-)

Done. :-)</thetext>

            <thetext>Clearly, the changes in Firefox versioning are to be reflected in qooxdoo&#39;s bug tracking system. Of course, it&#39;s not a smooth transition from a 3.1b3 to a 3.5b4. 

Well, what has recently been started by adding FF3.5 to qooxdoo&#39;s bugzilla has been finished now (thanks to Helder for helping to resolve this issue): all bugs that where previously assigned to FF3.1 are now on FF3.5. BTW, FF3.5b4 is due next week. FF3.2 is now replaced by FF3.6, but I guess once it is being released in 2010 it won&#39;t go by that name.</thetext>
