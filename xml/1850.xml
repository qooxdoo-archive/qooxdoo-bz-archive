            <thetext>Hello,

I hope this is the right address to put this problem. I just started using qooxdoo and
could not compile the hello world example using the generate.py.

I get an invalid syntax error

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;~/Sites/vocalscore/js/qooxdoo/application/demobrowser/../../tool/bin/generator.py&quot;, line 25, in ?
    from generator.Generator import Generator
  File &quot;~/Sites/vocalscore/js/qooxdoo/tool/pylib/generator/Generator.py&quot;, line 185
    triggersSimpleSet   = set((x for x in jobTriggers if jobTriggers[x][&#39;type&#39;]==&quot;JSimpleJob&quot;))

I am using Python2.5, the version 2.3 did not work as I assumed after reading the requirements
section. I tried qooxdoo 0.8.1 and 0.8.0, both with the same error. Could be a MAC specific
problem.

The create_application script worked fine. Guess, there is a simple solution.

Thanks an advance,

Jan</thetext>

            <thetext>The scripts work with python 2.4.6. You should mention, that 2.5.4 does not. It was only posted, that 3.0 does not! At least on MAC. Sorry for the trouble. Python 2.4.6 can be installed using port with

sudo port install python24

Hope, this helps !</thetext>

            <thetext>Jan, did you upgrade to Python 2.5.4. by yourself?
I am using Mac OS 10.5.6 and my version of Python is 2.5.1.</thetext>

            <thetext>I am still using Tiger 10.4.11 and I installed it using port. Actually initially only python2.3 was installed and a friend told how to get Python2.5 using port, which I needed for a science project. I don&#39;t know which version this was, but I recently did a 

port upgrade installed

So, when I encountered the problem, I had Version 2.5.4. Version 2.4.6 works fine. I am not familiar enough with Python to find the issue. All I found is, that the syntax for 2.5.2 should be
different for &quot;for&quot; commands, but I leave this to somebody who actually knows Python.

As mentioned before the current version of Python2.4 works fine. I already managed to get my first application running... Really great</thetext>

            <thetext>Jan,

it would be helpful if you included the whole Traceback, especially the final lines that show the actual exception thrown with details. It is very unlikely that this code runs with Python 2.4 and *not* with 2.5 (I&#39;ve tested with 2.4.5 and 2.5.1). Are you sure you were working on the identical framework files? Or did you e.g. unpack the SDK again in between? - It could well be that the error stems from an whitespace/indentation problem. Make sure the framework files are not altered on disk.

2.3 will not cut it, since the set() constructor was only introduced with 2.4.

            <thetext>Hi,

I just tried to reproduce the error, but since I installed python 2.4, also the 2.5 version works fine. Maybe there were some files missing in the installation? I also installed python_select. I am sure, that I tried version python 2.5.4 and using qooxdoo 0.8.0 and 0.8.1 seperately in different directories. Both with the same problem. The only message I can give you, was the syntax error I posted in the original message. 

Sorry for causing all the trouble. I really tried a lot of things to make sure, that this is not my mistake. Seems now, that is was some problem with my python installation...

Anyway, thanks for the fast help...
