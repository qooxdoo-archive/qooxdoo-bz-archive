            <thetext>Bindings immediately changes target property on init. This behavior is mostly disturbing on command bindings, cause this executes in most cases a apply method. It would be a good option to prevent this manner. May be a boolean property like “preventInitChange : true|false”.</thetext>

            <thetext>That would lead to an strange initial state of the connection. I mean you have told the code to sync the values of the properties but on the other hand, you want to stay out of sync initially? You can never trust that the properties are in sync then because you never know if already a change happend and the properties are in sync now.
The apply is only called if the value of that binding target changes and on changes, the apply should be called because it takes care of the things necessary to do when the value changes. So don&#39;t see a problem here.
Whatever problem you are trying to solve, I don&#39;t think thats a good way to do it because we would change the inner behavior and concepts of the binding mechanism.</thetext>
