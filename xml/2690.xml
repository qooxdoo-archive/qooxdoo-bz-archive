            <thetext>Wizards such as the &quot;Create new account&quot; wizard of thunderbird have form pages which contain not only form fields, but also elements such as icons or labels which are used to explain to the user what data they should enter in the form. It would be good if the automatic form management would allow for such elements which are not serialized and span the whole width of a form / form row.</thetext>

            <thetext>Martin, what are your ideas/comments here? You may want to unassign this afterwards, if you&#39;re not going to address this soon.</thetext>

            <thetext>I don&#39;t understand why those &quot;decorative&quot; elements need to be in the form itself? As long as they don&#39;t have any kind of functionality for validation or resetting, they don&#39;t need to be in the form on the logical layer. On the UI side, it&#39;s completely ok to have such widgets in there. For that, you would need to write your own form renderer and add these fields when needed. Or, another way would be to just use the validation manager and resetter without the form itself. That way, you can create your own user interface and add the needed widgets no matter where they are in the layout.</thetext>

            <thetext>As the purely decorative elements can be added to the layout, there is no need to have them in the form itself. They can also be handled by the form renderer separately so this wont be fixed.</thetext>
