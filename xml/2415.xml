            <thetext>For Gecko we implemented a special paragraph handling to keep all style attributes intact for the next paragraph. This way we can control the whole formatting stuff and can be sure that Gecko is not screwing things up.

This implementation 	has also some drawbacks:

  * Undo / Redo management is way more difficult (see Bug #2414 )
  * Gecko does add an additional paragraph which need to be removed by the component
  
Since Gecko has the ability to create a new paragraph with each line-break we should think over if we can let Gecko do the work and only correct the result. 

So we need to investigate and need to know 

  * Does the correction of the result break undo / redo?
  * What use cases are the one which need to be corrected?</thetext>
