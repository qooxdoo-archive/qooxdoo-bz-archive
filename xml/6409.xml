            <thetext>The new main demo page at http://qooxdoo.org/demos does not appear to provide access to the demobrowser, the most useful of all of the demos. In order to find the demobrowser, one must know to go directly to http://demo.qooxdoo.org/devel/ or http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/ to find it.

            <thetext>As the demo browser itself is not a demo, we did not include it into the demos page. We see it more as a tool for developer to get the code snippets and see how things can work together. Thats why we put the demo browser on the tool site [1] which can be reached from the demos page with one click.

            <thetext>I&#39;ll make one attempt to change your mind...

*I* know where to find the demobrowser, so I don&#39;t need the link. That&#39;s not the issue. At present, newer developers will have difficulty finding the demobrowser... if they find it at all. It should be obvious, someplace. The most appropriate &quot;someplace&quot; that I can think of is on the demo page, where people look for the various things they can do with qooxdoo. I really believe it belongs there. It needn&#39;t have a fancy icon and such, but there should be a link with a brief description so people will find it.

            <thetext>Sorry Derrell, your try to change my mind did not succeed but I&#39;ll try it the other way around by a question. Is the demo browser more important the the API viewer? I don&#39;t know but I&#39;m sure for a developer, an API viewer is important as well so why not put the API viewer on the front damo page as well? And what about the playground and the inspector, those are cool features as well... 
In the end, this is true for all tools we have but we wanted to make a cut at some point and wanted to minimize the number of demos to show on the front demo page. Thats the spot where people most likely see qooxdoo apps the first time. So we decided that the right demo apps are more valuable than a lot of demo apps with less quality (which is simply true for some demos in the demo browser and the demo browser itself). If you are using the framework, the demo browser becomes more valuable because you can use it as pool of ideas and snippets. But by that time, you should also know some of the other tools (at least the API viewer) and therefore be able to find that page which is only one click alway.</thetext>
