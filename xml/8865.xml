            <thetext>There is a difference between qx 4.0.1 and 4.1 double click on a table cell behaviour.

Before double click on a grid cell always opened an editor in case cell is editable, please try to double click any editable cell in this example:

http://demo.qooxdoo.org/4.0.1/demobrowser/#table~Table_Cell_Editor.html

Since I believe qx 4.0.2 behaviour has changed: now the editor is only opened if double click on an already selected grid cell, please try this example:

http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/demobrowser/#table~Table_Cell_Editor.html

If to double click a random cell with no selection on it yet, cell editor will not be opened.

I believe it is caused by the fix for:

http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8755

And also changes for the following issues involved:

http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8735
http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8780

Currently the following happens:

Method gestureFinish() (GestureCore.js:277) saves first of two clicks as a click on a cell, but the second click happens on a focus indicator, since it appeared after cell has been selected with the first click. So, targets are different and double click is not performed.

If to repeat double click on the same cell, it will work fine as now targets are the same - both of them are focus indicator.



I can imagine such a change in behaviour to be working as designed, but currently it does not look like that, since I could not find it documented in any way.

For our application&#39;s customers it would look like a regression, so we have to find some workaround for it anyway.</thetext>
