            <thetext>I used &quot;make migration&quot; to migrate from 0.7.2 to 0.7.3. I didn&#39;t run &quot;make distclean&quot; first, so was asked if I wanted to run it. I did.

Then the migration stage crashed because it was trying to migrate one of the files that had been deleted by the distclean stage. The command line log is below.

The migration script should re-establish the list of files to be migrated after distclean has run.

$ make migration

MIGRATION SUMMARY:

Current qooxdoo version:   0.7.2
Upgrade path:              0.7.3

Affected Classes:
    abling.fragment.handlers.CMailBox
    [...snip...]
    abling.translation.en
    [...snip...]
    abling.constants.CRequests

NOTE:    It is advised to do a &#39;make distclean&#39; before migrating any files.
         If you choose &#39;yes&#39;, a subprocess will be invoked to run distclean,
         and after completion you will be prompted if you want to
         continue with the migration. If you choose &#39;no&#39;, the making distclean
         step will be skipped (which might result in potentially unnecessary
         files being migrated).

Do you want to run &#39;make distclean&#39; now? [yes] :
make[1]: Entering directory `/cygdrive/d/abling/source_svn/trunk/abling/system/w
ebserver/www/user/client&#39;

WARNING: The migration process will update the files in place. Please make
         sure, you have a backup of your project. The complete output of the
         migration process will be logged to &#39;migration.log&#39;.

Do you want to start the migration now? [no] : yes
