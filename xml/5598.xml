            <thetext>We had an interesting phenomenon in the nightly tests where the Testrunner was unable to load another test package after the qx.test.bom package ran. This was due to the bom.media tests loading a large video file that wasn&#39;t finished downloading before the test ended. Normally, disposing the bom.Video object causes the request to be aborted, but when the Testrunner was loaded through the Selenium proxy, it remained at the &quot;pending&quot; state. Since several tests load this file, the browser&#39;s limit for concurrent requests was reached. It looks as though setting the Video object&#39;s source to &quot;&quot; (empty string) causes the request to be aborted in any case, which would fix the problem.</thetext>

            <thetext>Resetting the source in the destructor solved the problem as expected. Fixed for trunk and branch_1_5_x with r28626.</thetext>
