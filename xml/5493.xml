            <thetext>If I’m setting gzip to true at config.json, source generation fails with this error:

 

&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;-          &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;Generate packages  [Errno 2] No such file or directory: &#39;/xxxxxxxxx/asawizzard/source/script/asawizzard.8f246f580968.js.gz&#39;

 

Here is the relevant part of my config:

 

&quot;source&quot; :

                        {

                                   &quot;compile-options&quot;:

                                   {

                                               &quot;paths&quot; :

                                               {

                                                           &quot;gzip&quot;            : true

                                               },

 

Looks like, gzip is true, the generator is not creating source/script folder. After setting “gzip” to false it is working fine. Now you can again set it to true and no error accours but not .gz file is created. To reproduce this error just distclean before generation source with gzip:true option.</thetext>

            <thetext>Mustafa,

why do you want to compress a &quot;source&quot; version?! What should that mean? Class 
files are taken from their original location, so there is no way to compress 
them. The only thing left is the generated loader, which is not compressed 
currently in either version (source or build). Did you mean to have the loader 
script compressed?</thetext>

            <thetext>The immediate issue was that filetool.gzip does not create intervening 
directories (which filetool.save does). So opening ./source/script/blah....gz 
after a distclean failed, because the ./source/script directory was removed. 
This is fixed.

Now the generation runs through, but still has issues:
- The generated loader is compresses, so the filename (e.g. &quot;gui.js.gz&quot;) 
doesn&#39;t match the &lt;script&gt; tag in index.html anymore.
- A resource script is being generated (e.g. &quot;gui.adf1234.js.gz&quot;), but in the 
loader is referenced without &quot;.gz&quot; (e.g. &quot;gui.adf1234.js&quot;).

Hence, I leave this bug open. It might affect the build version too.</thetext>

            <thetext>The consistency issues have been solved, but the whole approach is a bit 
questionable. The loader script is now exempted from gzip&#39;ing, so the reference 
from indx.html doesn&#39;t break. All other scripts are gzip&#39;ped when the option is 
on, and the references to them are respectively to the .gz nams in the loader.

But I doubt this makes sense. I&#39;ve talked to Tino, and he said they used to 
have the .gz script files along with the normal files, and all references to 
them where to the .js (without trailing .gz) file names. The decision to use 
the .gz files was done in the web server, in exchange for the normal .js files. 
I believe this should save the web server from compressing the files on the fly 
(with mod_deflate etc.).

To support this properly the generator should reference the normal .js names in 
the loader, and generate the compressed .gz files *alongside* the normal .js 
files. But as this is just my take I&#39;ll leave it as it currently is until 
someone has a real problem with it.
