            <thetext>With the current approach of generating config.demo.json, a lot of boiler plate 
settings are repeated for each demo. The whole thing doesn&#39;t take much 
advantage of job inheritance. This can be improved by using some common parent 
jobs that bear most of the settings, and  generating only tiny child jobs for 
each demo that take advantage of those.</thetext>

            <thetext>Added a new implementation of generating config.demo.json (holding all jobs for 
individual demos), called &quot;config.demo.new.json&quot;,  using a new job template and 
a static config file with default jobs. Added a new consumer CreateNewDemoJson 
in gendata.py. The new generated config file is about .25 the size of the old, 
and much simpler in structure.

The old generation process is retained for a transitional period of time, for 
back references (creating config.demo.json). When everything works fine
- change gendata.py so that CreateNewDemoJson writes to config.demo.json, and 
disable CreateDemoJson
- change gendata.py:CreateNewDemoJson to load tmpl.json (instead tmpl.new.json)
- copy tool/tmpl.new.json to tmpl.json, and svn delete tmpl.new.json
- change config.demobrowser.json to &quot;include&quot; config.demo.json
- remove svn:ignore config.demo.new.json

and close this bug.</thetext>

            <thetext>Had to modify the solution a bit, as running individual demo jobs (like 
&quot;./generate.py -c config.demo.new.json build-ui.WidgetOverview&quot;) stopped 
working. The reason for this were the literal &quot;demo::&quot; prefixes used in 
demo.json when pointing to the theme-jobs in the &quot;run&quot; key of 
default-source/default-build.

(I investigated why this hard-coded prefix was necessary in the first place, as 
usually references to jobs in &quot;run&quot; and &quot;extend&quot; keys get adapted on import. 
The problem was that the members of these keys contained macros, like 

    &quot;run&quot; : [&quot;demos::source-${DNAME}-Classic&quot;, &quot;demos::source-${DNAME}-Modern&quot;]

At include time, these strings are not known job names, so the automatic 
renaming (prefixing with &quot;demos::&quot;) does not take place in Config.patchFeature.)

As a solution,  I&#39;ve removed default.json#default-source/default-build 
altogether, and moved their settings into the 
tmpl.new.json#source-XXX/build-XXX template jobs. I currently don&#39;t see a good 
way to maintain job refences with macros across imports.

            <thetext>Removed support for the old config.demo.json format, and renamed all references from config.demo.new.json to config.demo.json (see other comment).
