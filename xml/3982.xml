            <thetext>The &quot;library/namespace&quot; config key was to override the original name space of a 
library, as given in its Manifest.json. The implied utility of that was that 
the user could use two libraries with the same name space in a single app.

But this renaming of a library is only pretense. The user never referenced the 
library by its name space, neither in the config nor elsewhere in application 
code, so doesn&#39;t actually make use of the alias. It is only used in internal 
house-keeping. 

On the other hand, the items that are *provided* by a library, like its classes 
and resources, carry the *original* name space, whatever alias the user might 
have used in the config. So on e.g. the class level as well as the resource 
level, there could still be name clashes of two libraries that have the same 
name space (e.g. classes &#39;a.b.C&#39; in both libs, with &#39;a&#39; being the name space, 
or resource id&#39;s &#39;a/b/c.png&#39; with &#39;a&#39; being the name space).

There are several places in the generator that rely on the fact that 
  a) name spaces are unique over the entire scope of the app (complex name 
spaces allowed), and 
  b) any library name space is consistent with the name space part of class and 
resource id&#39;s

I think it is justified to just remove this key. Besides its questionable and 
unsafe semantics, I have never seen it used.</thetext>

            <thetext>Looks like a misconception indeed, so lets remove it. Please make sure to address/document it properly, e.g. in the migration section of the target release notes.</thetext>

            <thetext>Removed the documentation for library/namespace from the manual, also in 1.2.x. There was no supporting code for it anyway, so the documentation was actually wrong.
