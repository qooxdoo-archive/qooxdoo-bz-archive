            <thetext>The canvas layout, which is the standard layout one gets for document root, can apparently be used with the configuration {edge: 0} to obtain a kind of grow layout.

Currently, this has to be spotted reading the example application source code and is in no way ever explained in the layout&#39;s API page and only rudimentarily mentioned in the manual.

Please update the API page to include information to correctly describe:

* what is happening if edge is specified
* why and how the layout mimicks(?) qx.ui.layout.Grow with {edge: 0}

apart from that, as the feature is close to undocumented, but used by official example code, one could conclude that it&#39;s also safe to use in the future. Is that right?</thetext>

            <thetext>Although the edge property is documented in the manual [1] it isn&#39;t mentioned in the API documentation. So I fixed that:

master: 632f692795d080f449108cb68f918f79c9dcbe2a
branch_3_0_x: 1f6e08b3421821ffcff55b6e155c2bc7542aecb6

&gt; * what is happening if edge is specified

It&#39;s just a shorthand property as in CSS. So {edge: 0} does the same as {left: 0, top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0}.

&gt; * why and how the layout mimicks(?) qx.ui.layout.Grow with {edge: 0}

I can&#39;t answer that right now but the dedicated manual page states [2]:

&quot;This layout performs a lot better in these cases than for example a canvas layout with edge=0.&quot;
