            <thetext>It would be very useful to have tooltip support on a table cell level both in the current table class (for backward compatibility) as well as in the new virtual widget based table class. Could be implemented as a mixin, as probably many table instances will not require such a feature.

There was a abstract class ToolTipTable.js posted on the mailing list by Denis for 0.7.x, but there is no working code example and I am having problems getting it to work in 0.8.1 (although there are only about 10 lines of code that have 0.7.x specific calls, so perhaps it could be easily made to work by somebody with a little bit more insight into Qooxdoo internals than I have).
 
On the other hand, perhaps Derrell&#39;s new qx.ui.table.MTableContextMenu could be used as an example for such an implementation?

Cheers,
Fritz

P.S.: It would be very cool to have this for the current Table class in 0.8.2, although I realize that this is perhaps asking a bit much ... :-)</thetext>
