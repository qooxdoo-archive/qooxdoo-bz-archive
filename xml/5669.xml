            <thetext>Our error logging database contains the following error:
  this._marshaler is null (in qx.data.store.Json._onSuccess)

I am currently not able to reproduce this error, but I assume that this error is caused by the following sequence:
- a component (popup/form/...) uses the json store to load some data
- the json store calls a backend service, the backend service requires some
  seconds to return the response
- the user closes the component (popup/form/...) before the backend was
  able to return the request, therefore the json store gets disposed
- the backend returns the request.
  Then the callback method &quot;_onSuccess&quot; of the json store is called.
  This _onSuccess method accesses the property this._marshaler,
  but this property has been set to null by the dispose method
  This results in the error &quot;this._marshaler is null&quot;.

I see two different ways to solve this issue:
A) The following lines of code could be added to the top of the method
   _onSuccess :
     if( this._isDisposed() ) {
       return
     }
B) The Json store should have an instance variable that contains all currently running requests. This instance variable has to be filled by the method _createRequst. The dispose method of the json store then has to abort and dispose all running requests.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the good report Uwe. After some checks, I added the solutions you proposed as A). That seems to be the most solid solution. Additionally, checked that the store disposes its requests properly.
