            <thetext>Although MacOSX is a Unix-like platform, and starting the Bash startup script for buildtool from the Terminal application works fine, there are several issues running it from Finder, MacOSX&#39;s graphical file browser:

1) The startup script has to have a file extension of &quot;.command&quot;, in order to be executed (There are other approaches, but they are even more tedious, like using the &#39;SetFile -t APPL&#39; command).

2) On startup, the startup script will get the user&#39;s HOME as its current working directory, *not* the directory it was started in. This makes it difficult to navigate to the correct working directory to start the mini web server (which in turn uses this directory as its document root).

3) The DEBUG option of the script does not work, since there is no &#39;xterm&#39; application on MacOSX per default, and I couldn&#39;t figure out how to starting another Terminal application that will immediately execute a command string (-e option of xterm). I don&#39;t know if this is possible at all with Terminal, and what are possible alternatives.</thetext>
