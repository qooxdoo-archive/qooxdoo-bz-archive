            <thetext>Our flash widget (i.e. &quot;qx.ui.embed.Flash&quot;) generally doesn&#39;t work with IE 11.

See:
http://demo.qooxdoo.org/3.5/demobrowser/

In Detail:
The environment selection for &quot;engine.name =&gt; mshtml&quot; within &quot;qx.bom.Flash&quot; has to be adapted because with IE 11 this code doesn&#39;t work anymore. However the code executed with the setting &quot;engine.name =&gt; default&quot; works now in IE 11.</thetext>

&gt; This might be a good chance to remove the widget in general. I&#39;m not sure if
&gt; thats a good idea and the community needs the flash widget so we should check
&gt; that before thinking about a removal.

IMHO, abandoning the widget might not be the best solution:
1. Flash is almost dead in the mobile platforms but is still well alive in desktop platforms, for which qooxdoo support has been great;
2. Personally, I don&#39;t use that widget (as we use SVG instead) but I believe many will still find it useful;
3. We&#39;ve developed a similar widget for embedding SVG (not in the same scope of the contrib, which is to provide a canvas-like) and, although in production, it was never contributed as it needs further polishing to match qooxdoo standards;
4. I&#39;ve already hinted in the past towards providing even further media embedding support (such as audio), although there wasn&#39;t much reception.

Thanks for the feedback. Good to hear the opinion of devs using the framework!</thetext>

            <thetext>Fixed by applying the &#39;default&#39; code paths in IE 11 as suggested by Richard.
