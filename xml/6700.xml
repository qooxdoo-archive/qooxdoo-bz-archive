            <thetext>During the latest couple of days I&#39;ve contributed a PT translation for the legacy 0.7.x branch and 2.0.x (which I&#39;ve found to match the trunk, as of this writing).

Unfortunately, I&#39;ve found a few strings which apparently don&#39;t make sense to have been in the translated strings or which have a few inconsistencies.

String which shouldn&#39;t be in the translation resources:
* &quot;qooxdoo&quot; [showcase]
This is the framework name, should never be translated 

Strings which need further clarification:
* &quot;test Hello %1!&quot; [framework]
* &quot;test Jonny&quot; [framework]
* &quot;test One car&quot; [framework]
* &quot;test affe&quot; [framework]
* &quot;test one&quot; [framework]
* &quot;test two&quot; [framework]
These are apparently used in the testing framework but not details are provided for translators (translator notes) regarding if they should be translated or simply left untouched...

Grammar issue:
* &quot;%1 is not in the range from [%2, %3].&quot; [framework]
The range is already &quot;[from, to]&quot; so I believe this should simply be &quot;%1 is not in the range [%2, %3].&quot;

Spelling issues:
* &quot;test Jonny&quot; [framework]
* &quot;test affe&quot; [framework]
Probably one intended &quot;Johnny&quot; and &quot;monkey&quot;, respectively... ;-)

Minor inconsistency:
* &quot;%1 is not in %2&quot; [framework]
All other validation strings end with a punctuation mark, &quot;.&quot;, so there should be no exceptions for consistency reasons.</thetext>

            <thetext>&gt; Strings which need further clarification:
&gt; * &quot;test Hello %1!&quot; [framework]
&gt; * &quot;test Jonny&quot; [framework]
&gt; * &quot;test One car&quot; [framework]
&gt; * &quot;test affe&quot; [framework]
&gt; * &quot;test one&quot; [framework]
&gt; * &quot;test two&quot; [framework]
&gt; These are apparently used in the testing framework but not details are provided
&gt; for translators (translator notes) regarding if they should be translated or
&gt; simply left untouched...

Just realized that is already referred in the &quot;Translation&quot; page [1]:
«Please note: when translating the files for the frameowrk, you can ignore the terms starting with test , as they are only being used internally by the unit tests.»

Still, I guess providing translator notes would be much more clear.

Nits: &quot;frameowrk&quot; -&gt; &quot;framework&quot; and &quot;test ,&quot; -&gt; &quot;test,&quot;
