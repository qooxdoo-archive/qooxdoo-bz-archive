            <thetext>The API viewers direct links to the source code on GitHub are a great feature. 

Quite often, however, the master branch has changed from the version that the API was generated from so line numbers don’t match up and some methods might even have been refactored since.

Since you’re very disciplined about creating tags and branches in your source control, why not directly link to the source file with the correct tag name?

When I’m on http://demo.qooxdoo.org/2.1/apiviewer/#qx.ui.form.Button~_onKeyDown!method_protected, the “view source” link of this _onKeyDown method points me to https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo/blob/master/framework/source/class/qx/ui/form/Button.js#L312 which isn’t the correct line number for this method any more. The correct link would be https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo/blob/release_2_1/framework/source/class/qx/ui/form/Button.js#L312. When I’m on the 2.1.1 version of the API viewer, the link should point to …/release_2_1_1/… and so on.</thetext>

            <thetext>It would be nice to do something like this in apiviewer/ui/ClassViewer.js:

      qxGitBranch : function(node) {
        return qx.core.Environment.get(&quot;qx.revision&quot;) ?
          qx.core.Environment.get(&quot;qx.revision&quot;).split(&quot;:&quot;)[1] :
          &quot;release_&quot; + 
            qx.core.Environment.get(&quot;qx.version&quot;).split(&quot;.&quot;).join(&quot;_&quot;);
      }

This would ensure that the released versions has the desired links.

A problem for us during development would be that those links would point to a future, and yet unreleased, tag, so these links would be broken and we could never successfully test them.

The Makefile solves this by injecting the QOOXDOO_REVISION into the build runs during development builds, but it would be tedious to do the same everytime you want to build a framework Apiviewer by hand.</thetext>

            <thetext>This seems to work now. Can this ticket be closed? Or is a generic infrastructure for doing this still missing.</thetext>
