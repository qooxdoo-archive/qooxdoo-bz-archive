            <thetext>When disposing an object, the $$disposed flag is only set once the object has been disposed, but in between the start of dispose() and the end the object is in an undetermined state but there is no way to detect this because isDisposed() only returns true when disposal is complete. However, during dispose property values may be reset and listeners removed, and in some cases the object needs to know not to cause side effects.

The new isDisposing() method allows the object to detect this and act accordingly.

            <thetext>Sorry that description was not correct, the issue is that it is not possible to detect whether the dispose() method is currently running or whether it has completed.  This is the updated description from the PR:
