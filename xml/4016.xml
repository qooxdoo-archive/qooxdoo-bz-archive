&gt; Hi Adrian,
&gt; 
&gt; I can&#39;t reproduce this bug.
&gt; 
&gt; Here&#39;s what I did: http://bit.ly/9RkSB3

I have used win.show(), not open, as I reuse the same window multiple times and found it more appropriate. If you&#39;ll try with show, you&#39;ll see it happening (didn&#39;t know there was a difference between the two, the documentation doesn&#39;t specify).</thetext>

            <thetext>Instead of show/hide use open/close.

The open method calls show, activate the window and give it focus and the close method calls hide internally.</thetext>

&gt; The open method calls show, activate the window and give it focus and the close
&gt; method calls hide internally.

I cannot see a reason why show wouldn&#39;t focus (in that respect, maybe one set of methods would be enough?) and I still think it&#39;s a bug for a modal window to allow for any action to happen behind it. If it&#39;s not possible to fix, at least the documentation should specify the difference between them.</thetext>

We don&#39;t use focus in show/hide because this methods are inherited from widget class, and not all widgets are focusable.

&gt; in that respect, maybe one set of methods would be enough? 
Or better, for the window class, the show/hide should do what open/close does.

&gt; I still think it&#39;s a bug for a modal window to allow for any action to happen behind it. 

Yes, you&#39;re right.</thetext>

            <thetext>This is a known problem, but I can&#39;t do much because of the way of how show/hide is implemented. 

If you still wanna use show/hide you have to give focus to the window yourself, else just use open/close. They will this for you.</thetext>
