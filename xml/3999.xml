            <thetext>The concept of &quot;promises&quot; or &quot;deferred&quot; function return results is extremely powerful in asynchronous programming and needed when using qooxdoo on the server, for example with node js [1]. It has implemented, for example, in dojo [2]. I think that qooxdoo should have its own implementation. This will be helpful for all situations where simple callbacks are not enough.

            <thetext>I have already thought of that too but forgot to file a bug. Thanks for doing so!</thetext>

            <thetext>Kris Kowal has created an implementation which is very well thought out and use by many in the node.js world:

https://github.com/kriskowal/q#readme

The question is if it makes sense to invest time to re-implement an already solved problem (which would be a waste of time in some sense), or to simply create a wrapper to a license-friendly library such as q. One could also think of designing an API to which external implementations could be wrapped.

The main point is that there should be a native qooxdoo API for this so that we don&#39;t have to include external liberaries manually. For example, one should be able to use such API in the playground. 

Any thoughts?</thetext>

            <thetext>Such a wrapper sounds totally like a cool contrib! ;) 

I am not sure if we really need such a concept in qooxdoo because we are already event based and as long as I don&#39;t see a huge advantage of using promises, except of the buzzword, I don&#39;t force to use it. Maybe its nice but event can be too and thats the concept we use in the framework over and over.</thetext>

&gt; I am not sure if we really need such a concept in qooxdoo because we are
&gt; already event based and as long as I don&#39;t see a huge advantage of using

&gt; event can be too and thats the concept we use in the framework over and over.

I agree this can be manually included on demand, so I withdraw the feature request.</thetext>
