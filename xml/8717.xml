            <thetext>The website API viewer currently lives in the component/standalone/website/api folder which was good enough for the current master. But as the website API viewer is the only working API viewer at the moment, we should move the viewer code to its own folder in component.
Additionally, it would be good if the framework api job could build the API based on the website API viewer instead of having to do that in the website folder.</thetext>

            <thetext>Quick summary of some offline discussion with Martin:
The idea behind this task was to use the website API viewer as a library like the qx.Desktop viewer, generating it into different output folders like framework/api or any skeleton app&#39;s api directory. This would mean having to restructure the website viewer which is not currently defined as a library or really compatible with the build process. Since we haven&#39;t even decided on a solution to generate API docs in next-based applications (we might go with JSDoc), that&#39;s not worth the effort required right now. So instead, I&#39;ll just move the website viewer to framework/api and the required jobs/tasks to framework/config.json and framework/Gruntfile.js, respectively.</thetext>
