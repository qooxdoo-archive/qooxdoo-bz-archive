            <thetext>I could reproduce this consistently. I cleared the browser cache and it still happens.
I used the downloadable 0.8.3 version, Windows XP SP2 and python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Feb 21 2008, 13:11:45) [MSC v.1310 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
My browser is Firefox 3.5.3 (in the Portable Apps Version)
I even tried an absolutely fresh installed google chrome browser (never had this on the pc before) and the result was the same.

Could it help to provide the generated passwd.js (and the source files to it)?</thetext>

            <thetext>I was able to reproduce the problem with the generated application Werner sent me. It went away after I ran distclean and built again, however. Werner, could you please try running generate py distclean,build if you haven&#39;t already?</thetext>

            <thetext>I checked with generate.py distclean / generate.py build and it works now. I also checked with my original app and it worked.

I tried with a complete new tree and the bug didn&#39;t come again. I had source/script/passwd.js in question.

I could not belive that it should not be repetable. Out of this I diffed my saved passwd.js and the newly generated. I found that the variable this.__bu was used in 2 different places in the buggy version and only once in the working one.
Both used it in the event registration (line 1754 and following) and the buggy one starting line 9151. Might there be a namespace collision?

distclean removes source/script. Is this an curiosity bug (like the one before) or is this intended?</thetext>

            <thetext>Looks like this is an older bug (#2391) in the generator&#39;s private optimization that was believed to be fixed. I&#39;ve reopened it and marked this as one as a duplicate. Thanks for doing the extra debugging work, Werner.

Yes, distclean is supposed to remove all generated Javascript files, both source and build.
