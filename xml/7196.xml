            <thetext>The mobile Testrunner runs in Chrome, but gets slower after a few tests, up to 
the test basic.Image.testLoadingFailed, which eventually shows &#39;wait&#39;. Then the 
whole page is unresponsive (can&#39;t even close the tab by clicking &quot;x&quot;). 
Meanwhile, the tab is sucking more and more RAM (as apparent in Chrome&#39;s Task 
Manager), up to 0.75GB after a few minutes of waiting. Only chance is to kill 
the entire browser tab.</thetext>

            <thetext>This is caused by the fix for bug #7087: mobile.List now re-renders itself on every change event fired by its model (&quot;order&quot;, &quot;add&quot; and &quot;remove&quot;) as well as on changeBubble events. In the Test Runner&#39;s mobile view, we must remove and re-apply the list model item that represents a test whenever the test state changes in order to keep the GUI up to date. So now every test state change triggers several list updates.
Christopher tells me he should be able to reduce the amount of __render() calls in the List.
