            <thetext>On a regular basis, we see requests for features that are available in qooxdoo-contrib, but people don&#39;t find those features because they&#39;re not represented in the demobrowser. We should provide a standardized method of exporting demos from qooxdoo-contrib so that they could be easily incorporated into the demobrowser. This might be via an entry in the contrib&#39;s Manifest file indicating where the demo entry point is located, or (less desirable, IMO) it could be a fixed location in the contrib&#39;s hierarchy of the demo.</thetext>

            <thetext>We often talked about exposing/leveraging the contributions as a vital part of the qooxdoo framework. Since 0.8 the application setup and generation has changed, so this needs to be taken into account when consolidating and unifying the contrib infrastructure. Work has been started to further standardize contribs, which ultimatively might allow integrating them into the framework infrastructure (demobrowser, maybe other tooling aspects like testing).</thetext>

            <thetext>Increased prio, left target unspecified, as this topic has to be planned and scheduled taking into account various info and efforts. I&#39;ll assign to Alex to include this into some matching tasks of his, possibly involving Daniel for the technical realization.
