            <thetext>I think there is a problem with the table checkbox when it loses focus.  I think the problem goes back to version 0.8 as referenced in this topic:

http://qooxdoo.678.n2.nabble.com/Table-cellEditor-with-CheckBox-doesn-t-detect-change-tp2262194.html

Here is an example of the problem.  I have created 3 rows in a table with a checkbox column that can be edited.  If the checkbox is activated by double clicking on the cell, changing the checkbox value, the focus (blur) is not caught when it transitions to another element as seen by clicking on the button outside of the table.

Here is the sample of code that illustrates it:

In looking at the source code for qx.ui.table.celleditor.CheckBox in function createCellEditor(), it appears that the solution is the addition of a blur listener on the form checkbox that is created like so:

	  checkbox.addListener( &quot;blur&quot;, function(e)
	  {
		  this.table.stopEditing();
	  }, cellInfo );

This appears to have the desired effect that when a component receives the focus outside of the editing table, the editing is considered complete.</thetext>
