            <thetext>The methods qx.bom.request.Script.isDisposed and qx.bom.request.Xhr.isDisposed are missing from the optimized qxWeb build script (generated with build-min).

This seems to affect most if not all methods in these classes since we already added require hints for them (see bug #6557).</thetext>

&gt; Added require hints for the missing methods (b29f369 on master).

Daniel, I&#39;m confused. In the summary you wrote that require hints were already added, now you write you added require hints?! What about the change in the Generator code?!</thetext>

            <thetext>There already were hints for most methods in those classes, just not for isDisposed since that was added later. So I added a hint for that.</thetext>

So what&#39;s about the change in the Generator code we talked about when you were in my office?</thetext>
