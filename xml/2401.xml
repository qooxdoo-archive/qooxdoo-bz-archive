            <thetext>It would be nice if there was a uniform way to access those children of a widget that were added by the user through the public add method. This would be useful for example in the Inspector, where the Widgets window could have a toggle to display either the complete, &#39;internal&#39; structure or just the &#39;external&#39; structure which is what an application developer would probably expect to see. It would also simplify writing locators for Selenium tests, since the qooxdoo Selenium extension could rely on the external structure.

Currently, many widgets include the MChildrenHandling mixin which exposes the internal children, while some (such as TabView) implement their own getChildren method that returns only the &#39;external&#39; children. Others with only one child widget such as container.Scroll and core.ScrollPane have a getChild method while splitpane.Pane and form.RadioGroup do not have a getChildren method at all.</thetext>

            <thetext>After a brief discussion with Fabian, we came to the following conclusions: 
* The widgets that implement MChildrenHandling should already expose only the added/external children, so no changes would be necessary. I&#39;ll verify this just to make sure.
* getChildren methods will be added to container.Scroll and core.ScrollPane. getChild will be deprecated.
* splitpane.Pane will also get a getChildren method, as will form.RadioGroup (even though it&#39;s not actually a widget, it would still be useful for Selenium tests, for example).</thetext>

            <thetext>Daniel, please have also a look to the Tree widget. This widget doesn&#39;t implement a getChildren methods, so the inspector couldn&#39;t show the child elements, without using the _getChildren method.</thetext>

            <thetext>Implemented a getChildren method for qx.ui.tree.Tree in r19214 that returns an array with the root node.

Also modified the Inspector so that a widget selected with the &quot;Inspect Widget&quot; button will be displayed in the widget tree while it&#39;s in &quot;external widgets&quot; mode.</thetext>
