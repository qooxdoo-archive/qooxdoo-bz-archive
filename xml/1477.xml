            <thetext>The current, flat structure is not the best for the first time user. There is a folder called ui containing showing the basic ui controlls, another folder called widget containing demos to most of the widgets. Bigger widgets like the table do have their own folder for their demos. 

Thats kind of wired for the first time user because he sure does only search the widget folder widget demos and does perhaps not see the table demos. 

A quick solution for this problem, due to the fact that the generation of the demobrowser can not handle subfolders, is to rename the folders like their classpath names.
For example the ui folder would stay but the widget folder would be renamed to ui.widget. The tree in the demo browser has to read that structure and show it as a true hierarchy.</thetext>

            <thetext>The structure should definitely be improved. Often it might be sufficient to move some of the demos around to end up with a more concise structure.</thetext>
