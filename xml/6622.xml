            <thetext>It would be nice if we could introduce a testing infrastructure for the migration data to make sure it works the way it should. One of the important things is to have these tests also in the repo, maybe in a test folder right next to the info and patch folder. This test folder could contain a single js file containing lines of code which reflect a common set of statements which needs to be migrated. The best case would be to have a script which takes this test file and applies the migration just for that file.</thetext>

            <thetext>We had such a testing infrastructure for the 2.1 migration using a plain skeleton. Do you think thats good enough? That would be ok for me.</thetext>

&gt; We had such a testing infrastructure for the 2.1 migration using a plain
&gt; skeleton. Do you think thats good enough? That would be ok for me.

Sure. My understanding was that you wanted to have a &#39;test&#39; folder alongside &#39;info&#39; and &#39;patch&#39;, to provide test data. If this &quot;test data&quot; happens to be a skeleton, and this covers your needs (e.g. you can put all test cases in its class code), I&#39;m fine. I thought there might be more to it.</thetext>

            <thetext>No, I think that would be good enough for now.</thetext>
