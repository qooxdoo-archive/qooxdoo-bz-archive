            <thetext>This code:
	var req = new qx.io.remote.Request(&quot;file.xml&quot;, &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;application/xml&quot;);
	req.setTimeout(20000);
	req.addEventListener(&quot;completed&quot;, function(e) {
		returnXML(e.getData().getContent());
	});
	req.send();

Generates this error in the debug window:
qx.io.remote.Exchange[184]: Modification of property &quot;state&quot; failed with exception: Error - Missing Document Element!

The code in Exchange.js around line 520 has the state changing code, all the other states seem to change fine (sending, receiving, error, etc), but completed errors.  After the timeout is reached it auto-forces the request state to timeout.

Firefox doesn&#39;t have a problem with it, only IE (I tested 6, 7) throws the error.</thetext>

            <thetext>Please take a closer look at the document you&#39;re trying to load. There might be a slight error that&#39;s ignored by Firefox but not IE. Do you have the same problem in IE with the following very simple example XML?

&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;test&gt;
&lt;/test&gt;

If this one works, I suggest reducing the complexity of your document step by step until you&#39;ve determined the problem. It might also be an encoding problem - try sending the document as UTF-8 (and specify the encoding in the XML header).</thetext>

            <thetext>Apologies!

Marked as invalid, I didn&#39;t think to check my XML aside from w3c schools validation, which apparently isn&#39;t that valid!

It turns out a &quot;long hyphen&quot; got pasted out of MS Word into the database, which was in the middle of my XML file, ordinal 151 I think which is not a valid XML character.

Thanks for the follow up Andreas!</thetext>
