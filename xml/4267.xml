            <thetext>Stefan, I really don&#39;t know what the bug report is about. Could you please add some more details about what is wrong and ow to reproduce it?</thetext>

            <thetext>Stefan, this might be an issue with non-UTF8 files in your app. A regular qooxdoo skeleton app runs fine for &quot;LOCALES&quot; : [ &quot;ar&quot;, &quot;ar_JO&quot; ], so closing this as invalid.</thetext>

            <thetext>I can not see it is invalid.

We create &quot;ar&quot; and &quot;ar_JO&quot; fresh in the LOCALES and then we run generator translation -&gt; the files are created by the generator. We do NOT touch the files. Immediately run the generator source and then the error occurs.

We have also tried to open the files and save them as utf-8 deliberately but it has no effect.

The problem must be some other place in the generator code.

If we replace &quot;ar&quot; -&gt; &quot;fr&quot; and &quot;ar_JO&quot; -&gt; &quot;fr_FR&quot; then it works without any problem.

removed the ar.po (not used) file from the qooxdoo source/translation lib and then it works to generate!!!!

Conclusion: no utf-8 discrepancy found! All files were empty created by the generator. And we also tested saving deliberately as utf-8 without any difference. When we removed the ar.po file which was NOT in the LOCALES for qooxdoo frontend/framework/source/translation lib THEN it works...

So far we have reached here. What is the explanation when all files were of utf-8?</thetext>

            <thetext>Ok, so what happens if you do that for a newly created GUI skeleton? There shouldn&#39;t be problems ...

All files are supposed to be UTF-8. Make sure you don&#39;t save them with a BOM (byte order mark) as a leading sequence in the file contents. What operating system and python version are you using anyway?</thetext>

            <thetext>Hey Stefan,
is that one still an issue? If so, please reopen the bug and post some details for us to reproduce. 
Thanks,
