            <thetext>The following issues have been identified:

- There are two separate generator actions that involve localization:
  - an &quot;update-translation&quot; action (name preliminary)
  - the compile actions (compile-dist/compile-source)

- Both should share a list of locales to be supported (e.g. in the form of a
  macro like &quot;LOCALES&quot; that is used in all these jobs).

- update-translation runs the gettext/polib methods over the source code, and
  generates the necessary .po files for all selected languages. It has to make
  sure that changes to the source code are reflected in the .po files, as well
  as that new .po files are allocated for newly added languages in the list.

  The &#39;runUpdateTranslation&#39; method in Generator.py was basically designed to do
  that, but is currently defunct and has to be revised.

- The compile-* jobs need a new key &quot;locales&quot; which they then evaluate to
  generate the &quot;qxlocales&quot; entry in the bootloader file. This entry contains the
  CLDR data for the selected languages. The generation is already taken place,
  but has to be based on the new &quot;locales&quot; key.

- All of that has to be properly documented in the Wiki manual.

            <thetext>with r15496:

- 3 job actions take &#39;locale&#39; key with a list of locale names (&#39;de&#39;, &#39;de_DE&#39;, etc.): translation, compile-source, compile-dist
- &#39;translation&#39; triggers generation/update of .po files from source classes; .po files for newly listed locales are added, unlisted locales&#39; .po files remain untouched
- the &#39;compile-*&#39; actions trigger generation of bootstrap code data taken from .po files and CLDR data
- the data is put into global vars &#39;qxlocales&#39; (CLDR data) and &#39;qxtranslations&#39; (.po data); this allows use of specific localized strings while still use e.g. date/time format of another locale
- framework runtime classes (qx.locale.* etc.) adapted accordingly</thetext>
