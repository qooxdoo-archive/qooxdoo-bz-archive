            <thetext>Since a few days, the following data binding demos [1] wont start up due to a missing class. The original error message is:

Uncaught Error: Create event of type changeBubble with 
undefined class. Please use null to explicit fallback to default event type!

After some investigations I have seen that the missing class is the data event type which should be fired by the data array. Unfortunately, that data event isn&#39;t laded at that time but some time later.

[1] data.ExtendedTree, data.SingleValueBinding and data.TreeController</thetext>

            <thetext>I cannot repro the issue (r28031). All listed demos build and load fine, 
without raising any errors, in both source and build version. It might have had 
to do with the alternative agenda-based class exploration that I had 
operational for a couple of days, but revoked when we shifted bug#2366. There 
was another bug during that time that had issues with missing classes 
(bug#5285). 

Once I work on bug#2366 again (concurrency support), I will re-activate agenda 
search (classlistFromIncludeIterative). If then the problem pops again, please 
re-open.</thetext>
