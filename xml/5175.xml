            <thetext>Again, not the quality level I like it to be.

- The calculated numbers are always displayed in one row, no matter how much number are printed which means, you can&#39;t read the numbers when your viewport size is too small just set your width to 1024px (which should be wide enough) and enter 300 as number
- Speaking of 300, entering 300 and click the button will start the calculation which might take some time. Thats ok and the numbers appear very slow. But this could make the user think the calculation is done and he hits the button once more which leads to noting because the worker is still working.

- As an enhancement, It would be nice to have the used time somewhere
- Additionally, it could be helpful to mark that there is a fallback implementation and signal when it is used. Maybe include a switch button to switch to the fallback if workers are supported</thetext>

I can&#39;t disable the Calculate button until web worker finish calculating. Web Workers don&#39;t have a finished/done event...</thetext>
