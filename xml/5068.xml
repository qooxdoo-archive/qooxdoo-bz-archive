            <thetext>If someone uses only the part loading to load his application in parallel, the environment system should not be included in that &quot;preloading&quot; part of qooxdoo. Basically, these classes do currently use the environment system which should not:

qx.event.GlobalError - queries qx.globalErrorHandling --&gt; could use qx.$$environment[&quot;qx.globalErrorHandling&quot;] directly instead

qx.core.GlobalError - queries qx.debug --&gt; should use qx.Bootstrap.DEBUG

qx.io.part.Package - queries engine.name --&gt; should use the engine class directly

qx.io.ScriptLoader - queries engine.name --&gt; should use the engine class directly</thetext>

            <thetext>qx.core.GlobalError, qx.io.part.Package, qx.io.ScriptLoader has been changed as described in the report. 

qx.event.GlobalError was more work than expected because it also used writing access of the environment class. For that purpose, I introduced a minimal API to query the environment settings given by the generator into the bootstrap class. With that, I could make the dependency as optional for the GlobalError class which now can handle both scenarios, having the environment class loaded and not.

            <thetext>With the recent change of the environment class and how the dependencies are calculated, this problem should be gone.</thetext>

            <thetext>If thats the case, can all direct calls to qx.bom.client.* be substituted with the ordinary qx.core.Environment.get? Is there a bug already? Can we revert all changes related to this bug?

For example, qx.io.part.Package is not using the environment. And there is qx.bom.request.Script which has some extra logic.</thetext>

&gt; If thats the case, can all direct calls to qx.bom.client.* be substituted with
&gt; the ordinary qx.core.Environment.get? 

That should be possible now.

&gt; Is there a bug already? 

No not as far as I know.

&gt; Can we revert all changes related to this bug?

No, I don&#39;t think so because a lot of things were change during that time and I don&#39;t expect the commits to be that minimalistic to be revertable without breaking something else.

&gt; For example, qx.io.part.Package is not using the environment. And there is
&gt; qx.bom.request.Script which has some extra logic.

We should have a look at that special scenario. I am not sure if its possible to use Environment here.</thetext>
