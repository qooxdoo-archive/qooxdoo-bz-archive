            <thetext>This is since Qx 1.4.

Examples:

Qx 1.4: http://tinyurl.com/6l3mubd
Qx 1.3: http://tinyurl.com/6dwcswf

Don&#39;t know the adequate severity, but I guess this is not a &quot;normal&quot; bug...</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report. Thats a good one which we should get fixed soon.

You don&#39;t need to bother yourself with the severity, I&#39;ll change it anyway. ;)</thetext>

            <thetext>Thats interesting! We already do have a unit test for exactly that behavior and it works like expected. Putting the code from the playground example in a plain GUI skeleton, I also get the expected exception. Seems like its a problem with the playground! Needs some more investigation...</thetext>

            <thetext>After some more debugging and evaluation, I finally managed to reproduce it in a skeleton without the playground in the current trunk! Should be fixed soon then!</thetext>

            <thetext>Finally, I found the source of the evil. It was the generator which removed the debugging code. Unfortunately, this has been fixed with some of the recent commits in the toolchain which caused much confusion during debugging! In the end, it should work now the way it is designed. 

But please keep in mind that these warnings only appear if &quot;qx.debug&quot; is on which is usually the case in all source versions and in the build version of the playground.</thetext>
