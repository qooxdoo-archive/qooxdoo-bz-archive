            <thetext>Some thoughts on this bug:

* Problem with this bug is:
   * There can be x target www folders
   * User would have to copy paste all the jobs
   * We can not predefine target folders, as the folders might be outside the qooxdoo project

Better Solution:
* PhoneGap has a new Build tool : https://github.com/brianleroux/cordova
* We should replace the www folder of cordova with a symlink to our build folder
* By doing that, we always have the current state
* The PhoneGap Job should include the phonegap.js script, that can be loaded by the qooxdoo loader.js</thetext>

Cordova is already doing all things, we wanted to implement later. No need to re implement. When you want to use qooxdoo with Cordova, just replace the www folder of cordova with a symlink to our build  folder.</thetext>
