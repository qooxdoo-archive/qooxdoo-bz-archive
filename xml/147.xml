            <thetext>When a button having an icon with alpha transparency gets disabled, then the icon is shown with a opacity. This is done by setting a filter on the img-element. But by doing so the filter which patches the alpha transparency gets overridden.

A solution could be to set the opacity on a parent element of the img-element, so two filters could be applied simultaniously.</thetext>

            <thetext>Two filters simultaniously just don&#39;t work. That&#39;s a IE bug. AlphaImageLoader together with other stuff just doesn&#39;t work. The interesting thing, that this is also true for IE7, where the png support was announced as native.

It also doesn&#39;t work if applied to two different objects. The reason why it gets overridden is because of this bug. This is the wanted behavior.</thetext>
