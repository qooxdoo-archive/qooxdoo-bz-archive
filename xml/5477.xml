            <thetext>I&#39;m currently working with the dependency logging of the generator. My goal is to remove dependencies in the lowest parts of the framework and therefore it helps a lot to have those graphs. But unfortunately, the graph also shows indirect load time dependencies wich leaves it to the user to find the true dependency to remove to gut of a class e.g.
I would vote for removing those transitive dependencies from the graph.
Btw. it would also help to have load and runtime deps in one graph, maybe somehow marked by a color.</thetext>

Ok, understood. Just be aware that you will then loose some load-deps in the 
graph.

&gt; Btw. it would also help to have load and runtime deps in one graph, maybe 
somehow marked by a color.

This already works, just set &#39;phase&#39; to null.</thetext>

            <thetext>I&#39;ve added a new config key,

          log/dependencies/include-transitives

It defaults to true, but if set to false, the transitive dependencies are 
stripped, and only the dependencies directly referenced in the class code are 
included.

(A good class to test this with is qx.core.Init, which has only 6 lexical 
dependencies, but more than 25 if transitive deps are included).

With r28553.</thetext>
