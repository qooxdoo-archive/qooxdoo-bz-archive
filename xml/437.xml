            <thetext>When I place a DateTimePicker (which I believe is Qooxdoo control, it&#39;s the one included in VCL For PHP 1.0) on a PageControl (which, again, I believe is a Qooxdoo control, same inclusion) the calendar doesn&#39;t appear to &quot;pop up&quot; when you click on the pull-down button.  I believe (from what I&#39;ve observed by placing it near other components) this is because the calendar is popping up &quot;behind&quot; everything else, as opposed to appearing (1) on the same &quot;Layer&quot;, and (2) On top of all controls on that layer.

I openned up the qx.js file in VCL for PHP and did a search on &quot;Version&quot; and 6.5 came up, so I&#39;m filing this as a 6.5 bug which may have already been fixed as I see we&#39;re up to 0.7.  I don&#39;t necessarily have the ability to check a newer version at this time.</thetext>

            <thetext>I think this is a bug of VCL4PHP. If you can&#39;t reproduce the same behavior in pure qooxdoo js code, please don&#39;t post such VCL related bugs here. Thank you.</thetext>
