            <thetext>Right now the build cache is located inside of the project folders. This has several 
drawbacks:

1. The cache cannot be shared among different projects. Each project has to rebuild the
  cache from scratch
  
2. The cache can grow pretty large. With each application having its own cache this can sum
  up
  
3. IDEs -  especially Eclipse with Mylyn - can get really slow, when refreshing the workspace
  finding hundreds of new cache files. 
  
4. SVN: Each new project checked in must be configured to ignore the cache directory

I would suggest to move the cache directory to the system&#39;s temp directory and make
it possible to share the cache between all qooxdoo projects .</thetext>

            <thetext>I checked: There is a Python module that interfaces to some &quot;system temp&quot; 
directory. On *ix, this seems to be /tmp
on Windows boxes some subdirectory under the user-specific 
%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%
(e.g. &quot;Local Settings\Temp&quot; on XP).

This looks fine to me and should have the desired effect. Will implement that.</thetext>

            <thetext>Moving it to %TEMP% is basically OK I think.

Just want to note that sharing the cache between different projects might be harmful because of different versions of the same classes which might be used in these projects. When we want to allow this we need to be sure that we somehow add the absolute file name to the hash appended to the basic file name so we get unique cache files names when having to &quot;Button&quot; classes in the same namespaces but in different folders.</thetext>

            <thetext>Added support for system defaults (generator/config/Defaults.py). Now it is possible to used &quot;system macros&quot; that are supplied by the system, rather than being defined in some Json config. The first available system macro is TMPDIR which holds a platform-dependend temporary directory. It should be possible to override system defaults in Json configs (e.g. config.json).

            <thetext>There have been concerns on the ML related to using the /tmp directory for the 
cache on *ix systems, since there is a likelyhood that /tmp files get deleted 
during reboot or other sys maintenance procedures. Therefore, a different 
location was favoured.

Suggestions are:

* QOOXDOO_PATH/cache, as it was previously.
  This would lead to a cache per qooxdoo installation, and cache re-use across 
qooxdoo installations would not be possible, but I think this would be very 
acceptable.</thetext>

            <thetext>Here is an improved enhancement suggestion:

- create-application receives another CL option to specify the cache, like 
--cache &lt;path&gt;.
- if not supplied the cache path will default to &quot;TMPDIR/cache&quot;, as it is now.
- the cache direcotry will be made explicit in the config.json in the CACHE 
macro.

Additionally, we could add an interactive mode to create-application:
- if run interactively create-application might prompt for an answer whether 
the cache should be &quot;local&quot;/&quot;global&quot;, &quot;local&quot; meaning the &quot;./cache&quot; directory 
from the application root.
- if &quot;global&quot; is chosen, it will prompt for a path to the cache directory, 
maybe offering some  suggestions that can be picked from, with again 
&quot;TMPDIR/cache&quot; as the default, &quot;QOOXDOO_PATH/cache&quot; as another one, and maybe 
&quot;~/.qooxdoo/cache&quot; as yet another one on *ix systems.

I think this adresses most concerns mentioned. It means, though, that you have 
to provide this information with every invocation of create-application.

Comments were:
- The interactive mode is welcomed.
- Invoking create-application with more options is not an issue, since it is 
rare in real development.
- A config file in ~/.qooxdoo would be favoured; there will be a separate bug 
for this.</thetext>

            <thetext>- create-application.py now takes another cl option, --cache &lt;path&gt;, to 
indicate the cache path
- the skeletons all have the CACHE macro in their let sections, which will be 
filled by create-application.py
  - the default value is ${TMPDIR}/cache
