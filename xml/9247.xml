            <thetext>This is a feature request.

Every now and again I slide into situations wishing to pause a binding and fulfil this binding after circumstances has changed. I would like to something like the &#39;ignoreConverter&#39; option, maybe called &#39;pauseConverter&#39;.

An example.
Imagine a tabview including a few tabpages. Tabview owns a changeable property called &#39;project&#39;, which is bound to all tabpages. So all tabpges has their own property &#39;project&#39;. If a tabpages project changed, some other stuff will be executed like loading data. As you see, it is not necessary to fulfil bindings to all unseen tabpages. You only need to fulfil the binding to the open tabpage. Only if an other tabpage will become open, the paused binding should be fulfilled to the recent open tabpage.

I hope you could follow my ideas and understand my issue.
