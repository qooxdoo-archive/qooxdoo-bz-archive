            <thetext>The qx.ui.basic.ScrollBar is missing a #module declaration. This randomly breaks the build. 
Suggest to add #module( ui_basic )
The attachment #1 for bug http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=352 includes a module declaration.</thetext>

            <thetext>Why should a &quot;missing&quot; module definition break a build. Please explain this. To add ScrollBar to the basic module is bad because it is not that basic currently (only used by Table and ListView currently) and would result into too much overhead for applications which don&#39;t use anyone of these.

Interesting is that it breaks &quot;randomly&quot;. I don&#39;t even can think about scenarios like this. What is your exact include definition you use the generate the build version?</thetext>

Sorry for not being precise, it broke *my* build, which contains code that depends on ScrollBar.

My assumption was as it resides in package qx.ui.basic, it would also belong to module ui_basic

&gt; like this. What is your exact include definition you use the generate the build
&gt; version?
I checked out from trunk (8711) -&gt; built -&gt; ScrollBar.js was included  -&gt; changed ScrollBar.js -&gt; built again -&gt; ScrollBar.js wasn&#39;t included any more

            <thetext>With this defintion I don&#39;t get the scrollbar included at all. Independenly from the changes I apply to the scrollbar.

This is quite logical because none of the classes you include need the ScrollBar widget.</thetext>
