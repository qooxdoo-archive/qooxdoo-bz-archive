            <thetext>Desktop browser are setting the focus on &quot;mousedown&quot; event, even if you are using touch device emulation on Chrome.

Android sets the focus on a &quot;tap&quot; event, asynchronously. IOS doesn&#39;t set focus DIV elements by user interaction , however. But it can be set by statement, which was implemented at Bug #8450. By the way .focus() on IOS will be applied asynchronous, too.

So touch devices are normalized, but if we think about normalization over desktop and touch devices, we should think about to force all devices into line.


Recommended to focus elements on &quot;mousedown&quot; event, if possible!</thetext>
