            <thetext>In some cases IE returns null for indexOf() of a String. If this is the case the qx.lang.String.removeListItem function never finishes. 

To fix the bug, change the while-loop to something like this:

do { if (p == null) break; a.splice(p, 1); }
while((p = a.indexOf(item)) != -1);


Note: 
I got a return value of null of indexOf() when I had the Xinha editor on the same page as a qooxdoo control. Usually the &quot;bug&quot; occurs when the general scripts of Xinha are loaded before qooxdoo. 
If needed I can provide an example.

In 0.6.6 it only affects the CheckBox control since it is the only control using the qx.OO.removeProperty function which then uses qx.lang.String.removeListItem.</thetext>

            <thetext>The problem is that both qooxdoo and Xinha add &quot;indexOf&quot; to the JS Array class but Xinha has a wrong implementation. Xinha return null,
while all browsers supporting indexOf and qooxdoo return -1 if the item could not be found. There is a bug report at Xinha but it is already a bit outdated and has low priority:

This is not a qooxdoo bug but must be fixed in Xinha.</thetext>

            <thetext>This is very good example why it&#39;s a bad idea (no matter how convenient it may be) to change the prototypes of built-ins. We discussed this on the mailing list, but it seems Derrell and I are the only people who&#39;d like to remove qooxdoo&#39;s extensions to built-ins.</thetext>

Thanks for pointing that out! I didn&#39;t get that far... I actually wrongly though that it was IE that returns null. </thetext>
