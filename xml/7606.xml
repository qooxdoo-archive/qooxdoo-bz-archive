            <thetext>I see two problem with the tutorials.

Make each tutorial standalone
-------------------------
At the moment, each tutorial except the fist, is based on another tutorial. This means we have to change code in the first tutorial, we also need to change it in any other tutorial. This is a lot of work which is not necessary at all.

Remove dependency to any external service
-------------------------------------
We started of with twitter as service, moved to identi.ca which is now also gone. As we ant to keep these tutorials for a while, we should get rid of any external service to make sure we can keep them the way they are.

It would be good if we could keep the basic idea of each tutorial and move it into a standalone tutorial where we work with proxies or no service at all.</thetext>
