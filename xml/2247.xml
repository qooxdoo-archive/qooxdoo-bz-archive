            <thetext>If you launch a QooxDoo application on a page containing a Java applet, the applet will be restarted. This is caused by the three lines in qx.ui.root.application that assign hstyle.overflow, hstyle.padding, and hstyle.width.

The workaround is to subclass qx.ui.root.application and replace the _createContainerElement method with one that doesn&#39;t do this.

Appears to affect FF3.5 only. I only verified this under OS X.</thetext>

            <thetext>Dave, have you tested it with the FF 3.5 nightlies, http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/ ? I guess it is still the same problem, though. You might also want to wait for the FF 3.5 final, and then document the behavior here.

Could you describe how the Java applet is included with the page (e.g. the usual tags in the HTML file itself vs. being part of a custom widget)? Are you aware of a similar issue with Flash, bug #2367?

            <thetext>Dave, have you had a chance to look any closer? Since you provided a workaround, this might be sufficient for this rather specific scenario. From your point of view, wouldn&#39;t a WONTFIX be sufficient here?</thetext>

            <thetext>WONTFIX is fine for me.
