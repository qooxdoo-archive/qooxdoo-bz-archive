    Warning: Unable to parse JSDoc entry

            <thetext>It is rather tedious to provide this information, as the JSDoc parser is only fed the individual comment texts, and has no information about the file and relative location where they were extracted.


I suggest grepping your source code for the given JSDoc entry.</thetext>

            <thetext>JSDoc warnings now come with file and line number.

Regarding mulitple warnings concerning the same code location, which was 
mentioned in one of the duplicate bugs:
JSDOC issues are logged when the comments are parsed. As most of the eventual 
results are cached afterwards (like dependency information or api data), they 
don&#39;t reappear on re-running the job on unchanged classes. The warnings 
themselves are currently not cached (in contrast to e.g. lint warnings).

An exception are package docs (from __init__.js files), which are always 
parsed, hence always warned about if there is an issue.

Coordinating the output of JSDoc warnings across all consumers of JSDoc 
information (compiler, lint, api generation, ...) so that they appear exactly 
once with every Generator run would require a major rewrite of those consumers, 
as they are currently not prepared to handle messages from JSDoc parsing. 
Ideally, JSDoc  warnings would be integrated with the warnings from source code 
parsing. If there is a desire to do so, open a dedicated bug.
