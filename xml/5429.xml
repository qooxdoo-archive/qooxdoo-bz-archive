            <thetext>This is a reminder that we should take care of the translations before we release. This means generating the translation files and check if the content is complete and valid (as good as possible).

Keep in mind to open up a follow up bug report for the next release.</thetext>

            <thetext>We shouldn&#39;t open bugs for items we have in dedicated to-do lists [1]. This would be swamping our issue tracker with unnecessary noise. And why would you open a bug for translations, and not for the other items?!

It wasn&#39;t working out for the last release, as the hand-over failed, but will hopefully be better next time.

&gt; The reason is simple, because thats something which effects the code. I also 
added the generate fix bug for me to have that documented that there is 
something to be done with the code.

Makes sense. This way it is easier to track resulting issues in the code, or 
involve different developers. I&#39;ve added links to both bugs on the How-to wiki 
page.</thetext>
