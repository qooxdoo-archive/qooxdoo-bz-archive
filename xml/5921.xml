            <thetext>To support the release process for an application we should introduce a &quot;checktranslation&quot; job. This job should check if all strings that are marked for translation are translated in all &quot;po&quot; files. It could print out all missing translations and exit with error code (so that it can be integrated into a release process which can be aborted when translations are missing).</thetext>

            <thetext>And what about strings that don&#39;t need a translation? Most of the time, the keys are in one language so you don&#39;t need to fill the translation file for that language. Additionally, there are some stings which might be the same in your base language and in one translated language. It could be fine to leave that translation empty as well. 

The general Idea of having a check is very good but I don&#39;t see a way how a tool can check if something is missing or not.</thetext>
