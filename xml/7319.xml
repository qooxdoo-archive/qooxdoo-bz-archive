            <thetext>Using native scrolling for div&#39;s of iOS is more scale-able. 
The performance is very fast. But our touch event handler slows it down. 

Point on a scrollable div and scroll up and down. In a profiler you can see a massive call of event dispatcher. This seems to decrease the acceleration. Because if you disable touch event handler manually, scrolling runs perfectly, even with a huge amount on child elements in the scroll container.


We should try to find a generic way to prevent firing touch-move events on scrolling natively.</thetext>

&gt; We should try to find a generic way to prevent firing touch-move events on
&gt; scrolling natively.

As there is no build in support for native touch scrolling, I can&#39;t think of a generic solution to that as far as I understand the idea. Could you be a bit mor precise about how you think that could work?</thetext>
