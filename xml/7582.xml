            <thetext>When trying to scroll the table content with swipe up down or left right (or vice versa) the table row where the swipe was started gets selected.

To reproduce open the widgetbrowser on an iPad and select the &quot;Table&quot; tab:

    http://demo.qooxdoo.org/devel/widgetbrowser/index.html

and the swipe up and down. The row where the swipe starts gets selected.

This is on iPad 3 with iOS 6.1.3.</thetext>

            <thetext>At the moment, this is a known restriction of the emulate mouse layer. The table changes it&#39;s selection on mousedown which will be fired by touchstart. At the moment of touchstart, we can not know if it will be a scroll action or anything else so we have to fire the mousedown event. Still, thats not a desired behavior and could be fixed in further versions.</thetext>

I see but this worked in version 2.1.2 as you can see in the table demo of the widget browser:

    http://demo.qooxdoo.org/2.1.2/widgetbrowser/index.html

A swipe here does NOT also select the row where the swipe started.

Any hints how I create a workaround for this?</thetext>

            <thetext>By reading

    http://manual.qooxdoo.org/devel/pages/desktop/on_mobile.html

the workaround would be to derive from qx.ui.table.pane.Scroller and use the click event for selection instead of mousedown.

This may also lead into using a derived qx.ui.table.selection.Manager.

Is this the direction to go?

            <thetext>I&#39;d like to aks if this bug will be addressed in the near future.

Note that combobox shows the same behaviour. You are not able to swipe through the popup list without selecting an item. As a result the popup closes and sets the value of the selected item.

Thank you for your answers.

Pinging back this issue.

As time passes I wanted to ask if the near future passed and if there is any chance to see this fixed in the not so near future ;-)
