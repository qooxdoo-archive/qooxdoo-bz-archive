            <thetext>Hi guys,

After a qx.ui.basic.Image is set and rendered I want to clear the source so that I have a blank image again. I tried this by doing setSource(null) and resetSource() and both were without success. The image is never rendered again and it might be the solution for bug #3701 what is causing the problem.

In qx.html.Image Line #79:

// Source can be null in certain circumstances.
// See bug #3701 for details.
if (source != null) {
   qx.bom.element.Decoration.update(elem, source, repeat, styles);
}

Here is some code for the playground I posted it on gist:
https://gist.github.com/863819
or
git clone git://gist.github.com/863819.git gist-863819

Thanks in advance,
Erol Demircan</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report. I just tried your demo code in the playground in my chrome devel on mac and it worked like expected. What browser / os combo did you use to test?</thetext>

&gt; Thanks for the report. I just tried your demo code in the playground in my
&gt; chrome devel on mac and it worked like expected. What browser / os combo did
&gt; you use to test?

Hahah that was just the browser I skipped yesterday because I thought that it would give the same results I&#39;ve tested it with FF3.6.15, ie 8 my os is Vista 64-bit ;( (My OS at work )</thetext>

            <thetext>I can confirm the issue. The problem is os independent. Only Chrome and Safari clearing the image, the other browsers (IE, FF and Opera) doesn&#39;t reset the image.</thetext>

            <thetext>I&#39;ve just checked this one with the revision 25767 (branch 1_3_x) and revision 
25764 (trunk) with the browsers FF 3.5.13, Opera 11.01 and IE 8 and 9.

Everything is working fine for me. I&#39;m closing this one now and you can 
additionally check the following URL to ensure everything is fine for you:

This is the current snapshot of the playground application.</thetext>
