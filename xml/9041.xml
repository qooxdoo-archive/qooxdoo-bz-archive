            <thetext>The current logging concept having an appender and all that infrastructure seems link of over engineered and too heavy for our lightweight approach. Maybe this is also something some else wrapped his head around and we could benefit from that. Anyway, we should see what requirements our logging system needs to fulfill and  how we could get those features without that massive load of classes.</thetext>
