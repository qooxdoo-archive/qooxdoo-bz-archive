            <thetext>The new Tree Virtual widget does a great job of letting you navigate the tree without changing the selected element.

The problem although is that while the element is actually slected as soon as you open/close another element, the selected one is not highlighted anymore.
This means that &quot;visually&quot; it seem not to be selected anymore and can lead to confusion in the user.

Solution:
keep the selected element highlighted even if other elements are opened/closed in the meantime.</thetext>

            <thetext>With the addition, a while back, of retaining selected nodes in the data model, there is no longer a need to clear selections upon open/close of the tree.  That (mis)feature has now been removed.

Thanks.
