            <thetext>In most cases, form binding is fine and really helpful. But dealing with lists, form controller is bound to first item of selectable widget. This behavior is not always desired. So having selectable bound to form controller and list controller, produces strange results when selection is calculated by some means (in opposite to user selection).

So in the example:
* first list is bound to both controllers and fed from form model,
* second list is bound to list controller and from from data array,
* third list is bound to list controller and from form model.

The last two work as expected. But when click in &quot;select&quot; under first list the selection is missing one element. Also continuously clicking &quot;select&quot; makes selection look like some array exercise.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report. I did not have the time to check out the whole example code but my first guess is that the problem is the not supported multi selection in the from controller (see bug #3830). I mark that bug as blocker for this one because we should first fix the multi selection first.</thetext>

            <thetext>Even though the binding workaround makes it possible, I think the use case is important to support it directly.</thetext>
