            <thetext>The property is 0 but initIconColumnWidth is never called inside the Menu class. So you always have to call it manually.

There should only be an icon column when there are icons.</thetext>

&gt; The property is 0 but initIconColumnWidth is never called inside the Menu
&gt; class. So you always have to call it manually.
Why do you think you have to call it manually? Do you have an example where it makes a difference?

&gt; There should only be an icon column when there are icons.
Do you think so because of its look and feel or do you want to save some objects in the application?</thetext>

            <thetext>I think an icon column without icons looks not quite good. See my example:

And I think qooxdoo objects should apply the initial values of their properties. This would make the API viewer more useful.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report and the demo. Seems like the apply method of this property needs to be called to get the manu the way it should be. We should check that and fix it.</thetext>

Agreed.

&gt; And I think qooxdoo objects should apply the initial values of their
&gt; properties. This would make the API viewer more useful.

Note that some properties are themeable. The property iconColumnWidth is one of them. To avoid confusion, please always make sure to take look at the section &quot;property attributes&quot;.

Both the modern and classic theme set a iconColumnWidth of 16px, effectively overwriting the initial value &quot;0&quot; you found in the API viewer. This explains the gap in your example and is actually to be expected. If you want no gap, you&#39;ll have to set the property in your code. User values overwrite theme values.

The reason why the theme sets a column width is to avoid growing/shrinking menus when icons appear/disappear. Like checking a check box for instance.

I improved the API doc a bit to avoid future confusion.

Fixed with r24983 on trunk and r24984 on branch_1_3_x.</thetext>
