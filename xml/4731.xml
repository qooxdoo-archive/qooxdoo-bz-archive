This error is illogical as it answers on something you don&#39;t want the generator to do. Looking at the code, there is unnecessary syntax checking of the config.json We can not find that the generator needs the info in config.json to clean up.</thetext>

This is not true. &#39;distclean&#39; is a job like any other, and for the generator to run a job it needs to inspect the config file(s), so there is syntax checking as well. No config - no job.</thetext>

Which would be equally true if the build system used makefiles instead of the current system. If the Makefile had invalid syntax, the clean or distclean jobs wouldn&#39;t be able to run.</thetext>

That is a definition of yours but not necessarily a necessity! But if you have defined it like that, well then ok!</thetext>

Still a matter of definition but not necessarily a necessity in the Makefile case too. The Makefile choice does not need to be the leading star of the choice. The decision should instead be based on the necessity of the generator. But as I said, ok then if that is a conscious decision even though it might not be a necessity.</thetext>
