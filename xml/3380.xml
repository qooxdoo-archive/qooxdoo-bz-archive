            <thetext>The skeletons that use alert() (currently gui, inline and contribution demo) 
all suppress warnings about this deprecated global by using the @lint 
ignoreDeprecated lint hint.

This weakens the &#39;generate.py lint&#39; test run in the skeletons, as it removes 
the only true positive that shows that ecmalint actually achieves something. 
And the users of the skeletons are no longer alerted that there is a piece of 
code in the skeleton app that they better remove.

I therefore suggest to remove the @lint ignoreDeprecated(alert) again from 
those skeletons, to make the desireable warning be issued again.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thomas, we talked about that and agreed to keep it the way it is, thus wontfix.

Unlike those alerts that are used for debugging purposes, and which should indeed be reported by lint, in this case it is a &quot;regular&quot; alert box as part of the app. You&#39;re right in that the skeleton wouldn&#39;t show lint warnings, but a new user could get to know about the lint feature by noticing the intended ignores.

Your idea of having a setup in which to test ecmalint is a good one. Could you open a separate enhancement for such a test(able) environment, please?</thetext>
