            <thetext>Currently, the following two advanced features are configurable but enabled by default: dynamic runtime switching of locales (desktop and mobile) and of themes (desktop). Their environment keys are qx.dynlocale or qx.dyntheme, respectively.

As advanced features they come with a certain overhead for regular apps, which typically don&#39;t use those features. Thus they should be turned off by default, and the developer should opt-in to turn any of those on.

            <thetext>Changing from opt-out to opt-in should be handled in a major release, i.e. qooxdoo 3.0, with appropriate release/migration notes.</thetext>

            <thetext>Why should we disable these features by default if there is no penalty in modern browsers? If we want to change the default behavior of qx.dynlocale (qx.dyntheme hasn&#39;t been release jet) it has to have a benefit for most of the people.</thetext>
