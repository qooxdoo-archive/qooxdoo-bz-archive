            <thetext>I noticed that changing the selection behavior in 4.0 seems to have also affected &quot;contextmenu&quot; behavior.  In certain cases I need to right-click twice before I see a context menu -- first to &quot;move&quot; the selection and then to display the context menu.  For example: open up several several levels of TreeFolders. To bring up the context menu requires 2 right-click&#39;s on a TreeFile but then right-clicking on a different &quot;sibling&quot; TreeFile only needs 1 right-click.</thetext>

&gt; Do you have any sample for us how to reproduce? A playground sample would be
&gt; best.

I&#39;m currently on vacation until the 20th and although I can do email on my laptop I would be hard pressed to come up with a sample before then.</thetext>

            <thetext>Not sure if I created the playground sample correctly but the following url will get you there:

http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/playground/#%7B%22code%22%3A%22var%2520tree%2520

and (at least for me) I needed to then click on bug8482.

If you open up the tree until leafs appear at any level and then right-click on a leaf you need to do so twice until the alert occurs.  If you then right-click on a sibling leaf the wrong alert is displayed since the selection did not change.  At this point you need to left-click on another leaf (within any subtree) before you can right-click on it and get the correct value.  Note that there may be nothing wrong with your sdk and perhaps it is the way I implemented the contextmenu listener, but it worked differently under 3.5.</thetext>

            <thetext>It worked for me but I needed to click on bug8482 in the Samples column.  Is there any docs as how to correctly create a playground sample?  The code I used is as follows:

var tree = new qx.ui.tree.Tree();
tree.set({
    width: 300,
    height: 500
})
this.getRoot().add(tree);

var root = new qx.ui.tree.TreeFolder(&quot;root&quot;);
tree.setRoot(root);

for (var i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
  var l1Branch = new qx.ui.tree.TreeFolder(&quot;level &quot;+i);
  root.add(l1Branch);
  for (var j = 0; j &lt; 5; j++) {
    var l2Branch = new qx.ui.tree.TreeFolder(&quot;level &quot;+i+&quot;.&quot;+j);
    l1Branch.add(l2Branch);
    for (var k = 0; k &lt; 5; k++) {
      var leaf = new qx.ui.tree.TreeFile(&quot;leaf &quot;+i+&quot;.&quot;+j+&quot;.&quot;+k);
      l2Branch.add(leaf);
    }
  }
}

tree.getChildControl(&quot;pane&quot;).addListener(&quot;contextmenu&quot;, function(e) {
  var sel = tree.getSelection()[0];
  if (sel instanceof qx.ui.tree.TreeFile) {
    alert(sel.getLabel());
  }
});

root.setOpen(true);</thetext>

            <thetext>You can close this bug.  As soon as I changed:

var sel = tree.getSelection()[0];

to:

var sel = e.getTarget();

The problem no longer occurs.  This is probably what I should have done in the first case.</thetext>
