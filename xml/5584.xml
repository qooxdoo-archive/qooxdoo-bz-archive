            <thetext>qx.bom.Viewport.getWidth/Height functions try to access doc.body.* when browser runs in the quirks mode which stops the execution with an exception since doc.body is null. Apparently, doc.documentElement is perfectly valid, so after disabling the conditional checks my app runs fine. Strangely, this happens only in the &quot;build&quot; variant, &quot;source&quot; is somehow O.K.

To reproduce, remove the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; header from index.html of the skeleton template. Tried with FF, Opera, Chromium.

Looking at the MDN docs &lt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/mozilla_quirks_mode_behavior&gt;, I see no mention of this difference (doc.body vs. doc.documentElement) regarding clientWidth/Height, only scroll*.</thetext>

            <thetext>I had the same problem when migrating from v1.4.2 to v1.6 (Revision 28643 from svn):

&quot;i.body is null&quot;

Thanks. For me, a few trivial changes (mainly adding the DOCTYPE header) made the HTML compliant so the bug is no longer triggered.

From the maillist thread discussion it sounds indeed like a timing issue.</thetext>

            <thetext>I can confirm Marcel´s description. 
We kept track of the same behaviour and solved this issue by loading the bootstrap script in the body of the document instead of loading this script in the header of the document - just like Marcel suggested.
In my humble opinion it is a matter of a timing issue. We could not reproduce it every time, but the probability to reproduce it was higher if the browser cache was filled (i.e. the script is not loaded from the server) and if the script was rather big (let´s say more that 1 MB), because in this case the browser is heavily busy but does not have to wait for the response of the script, so the script is executed before some other things are done by the browser, which perhaps is the problem.</thetext>

            <thetext>This is rather a timing issue than an issue with the current implementation. 

In standard mode the root of the document is considered to be 
&quot;document.documentElement&quot; whereas in quirks mode the root of the document is 
considered to be &quot;document.body&quot;.

This is what the implementation reflects. If you try to get the viewport width 
/ height before the body is loaded then you run into problems.

The solution is to use the standard mode in this case and you&#39;re done, since 
then the &quot;document.documentElement&quot; is used.
