            <thetext>During the release testing, I realized that on Win8, the job &#39;source-server-reload&#39; job does not seem to work as expected. The server will be started and you can load the app sometimes once or twice sometimes that does not work at all. Change the code does never trigger a reload. Instead, it seems to crash the hole cmd shell.</thetext>

            <thetext>&#39;source-server-reload&#39; works as designed, both on Win7 and Win8.

The issue were 2 details that you probably missed during testing:

- You have to start &#39;generate.py watch&#39; *additionally*, in a seperate shell. 
(This is in the docs, but I also forgot it :).

- You have to load the *complete* URL for the app, including &quot;.../index.html&quot;. 
(This I wasn&#39;t aware of myself, but the web server doing the reload 
specifically reacts on the &quot;.../index.html&quot; URL, and instruments the page. This 
obviously doesn&#39;t happen when you just request the directory URL, like with 
&quot;http://localhost:50047/test/gui/source/&quot;).

I&#39;ve added more information to the manual (default_action_jobs), to clarify 
this.</thetext>

            <thetext>A special issue arises when using IE9/10 , see bug##7564. The described setup 
works fine on Win8 with other browsers (Chr, Opr, FF, ...).</thetext>
