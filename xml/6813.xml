            <thetext>Hi,

I have an issue where the ThemedIFrame doesn&#39;t work for a particular link, but works for others. There are no errors. I was able to replicate it from the playground.

Here is the link I was trying to use in the ThemedIFrame:
http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?zoneid=ORZ005&amp;TextType=1

Any ideas?</thetext>

&gt; Just checked your sample and it worked. What browser did you use?

I was using Chrome, but I wonder if it was because I was vpn&#39;ing into my account? I tried it from my office account and it worked this morning. It was a little strange because every other site I tried worked over the vpn, except that one.</thetext>
