            <thetext>When pressing a button in version 3.5 it did not matter how long the left mouse button was pressed.

In Qooxdoo 4.0.1 it looks like you are not allowed to hold the left mouse button down for more than half a second (or maybe even less).

To reproduce:
1. Go tot the playground for 3.5:
http://demo.qooxdoo.org/3.5/playground/#%7B%22code%22%3A%22%252F%252F%2520Create%2520a%2520button%250Avar%2520button1%2520%253D%2520new%2520qx.ui.form.Button%28%2522First%2520Button%2522%252C%2520%2522icon%252F22%252Fapps%252Finternet-web-browser.png%2522%29%253B%250A%250A%252F%252F%2520Document%2520is%2520the%2520application%2520root%250Avar%2520doc%2520%253D%2520this.getRoot%28%29%253B%250A%250A%252F%252F%2520Add%2520button%2520to%2520document%2520at%2520fixed%2520coordinates%250Adoc.add%28button1%252C%250A%257B%250A%2520%2520left%2520%253A%2520100%252C%250A%2520%2520top%2520%2520%253A%252050%250A%257D%29%253B%250A%250A%252F%252F%2520Add%2520an%2520event%2520listener%250Abutton1.addListener%28%2522execute%2522%252C%2520function%28e%29%2520%257B%250A%2520%2520alert%28%2522Hello%2520World!%2522%29%253B%250Abutton1.setShortCut%28%2522F1%2522%29%253B%250A%257D%29%253B%22%2C%20%22mode%22%3A%22ria%22%7D
2. Now click with the left mouse button on &#39;First Button&#39; and keep the left mouse button pressed for a couple of second
3. Now let go of your left mouse button and see the alert &#39; Hello World!&#39;
4. Now go to the playground for qx 4: http://demo.qooxdoo.org/4.0.1/playground/#%7B%22code%22%3A%22%252F%252F%2520Create%2520a%2520button%250Avar%2520button1%2520%253D%2520new%2520qx.ui.form.Button%28%2522First%2520Button%2522%252C%2520%2522icon%252F22%252Fapps%252Finternet-web-browser.png%2522%29%253B%250A%250A%252F%252F%2520Document%2520is%2520the%2520application%2520root%250Avar%2520doc%2520%253D%2520this.getRoot%28%29%253B%250A%250A%252F%252F%2520Add%2520button%2520to%2520document%2520at%2520fixed%2520coordinates%250Adoc.add%28button1%252C%250A%257B%250A%2520%2520left%2520%253A%2520100%252C%250A%2520%2520top%2520%2520%253A%252050%250A%257D%29%253B%250A%250A%252F%252F%2520Add%2520an%2520event%2520listener%250Abutton1.addListener%28%2522execute%2522%252C%2520function%28e%29%2520%257B%250A%2520%2520alert%28%2522Hello%2520World!%2522%29%253B%250Abutton1.setShortCut%28%2522F1%2522%29%253B%250A%257D%29%253B%22%2C%20%22mode%22%3A%22ria%22%7D
5. Again, press on button &#39;First Button&#39; and keep the mous ebutton pressed for a couple of seconds
6. Now release the mouse button and see that nothing happens
7. Now quickly press the left mouse button and see that only then the &#39;First Button&#39; reacts to the click.

The result is that slow users are unable to click buttons anymore.</thetext>

            <thetext>This is by intention because we introduced the concept of a longtap which is quite common on mobile devices. The current threshold is 500ms. If a tap / click take more that this time, a longtap instead of a tap is fired. If you want to change that, just take a look at the static

qx.event.handler.GestureCore.LONGTAP_TIME

which holds the long tap time. Setting it to something incredibly high would remove the long tap at all and you would be back at the old behavior but could not use the long tap anymore. So basically it up to you. :)</thetext>

&gt; I can imagine that for tapping you want to have this timeout value, but
&gt; clicking with a mouse has been for ages, on all OSses, an unlimited timeout
&gt; value, which mouse users are accustomed to

The idea of moving the framework to pointer was to have a common event mechanism for mouse and touch. So changing that would be kind of against the basic idea of the whole effort.</thetext>
