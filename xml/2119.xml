            <thetext>In rare cases we receive such an error on AJAX request in Internet Explorer 7 when we try to read the response. Unfortunately there is no reproducible scenario available. We read the response text when the &quot;complete&quot; event is fired. It seems that the &quot;complete&quot; event is fired before the readyState become 4 in IE. Looking at the Exchange#wasSuccessful there is one suspicious place where the method returns true if readyState is different than 4 - the case with status code -1.</thetext>

            <thetext>Not being easily reproducible may make it hard to track down the issue. Ivan, any chance you come up with a scenario?

Do some of the &quot;transport/RPC guys&quot; (e.g. Derrell, Andreas, Alex) have observed such an issue or have an idea? It may be happening in 0.8.x as well, since the underlying code may not have changed?</thetext>

            <thetext>Could someone of the &quot;transport/RPC guys&quot; take a look at the code in Exchange#wasSuccessful()?	
What does a statusCode of -1 mean?
Why does statusCode == -1 and readyState &lt; 4 return true?
Could a request with statusCode -1 ever trigger a &#39;completed&#39; event?
The comment &quot;// Not Available (OK for readystates: MSXML&lt;4=1-3, MSXML&gt;3=1-2, Gecko=1)&quot; does not match the code below.
Would it help to know the MSXML version? If so, how can it be determined?</thetext>

            <thetext>This code is a bit bizarre, but Exchange#wasSuccessful() is given a status code of -1 if an attempt to retrieve the status from a request throws an error:

    getStatusCode : function()
    {
      var vStatusCode = -1;

      try {
        vStatusCode = this.getRequest().status;
      } catch(ex) {}

      return vStatusCode;
    },

This would indicate to me that either there&#39;s a bug (getRequest() returns null because there&#39;s no request in progress) or the request has no status member (very strange).

The comment in wasSuccessful should probably say, &quot;Status code was not available&quot;, but why that&#39;s OK for various MSXML versions I have no idea.

(A complete rewrite of qx.io.remote such that it&#39;s readable and better organized would be a really nice project for someone with good networking experience who&#39;s looking to contribute to qooxdoo!)

            <thetext>Just got the bug to my radar. Thanks Andreas.

It relatively easy to explain as nearly every Ajax lib has such a workaround.  The issue is that in IE under some conditions a few properties throw some kind of access errors while other browser do not have an issue. &quot;-1&quot; is this case basically means that the browser not yet allows to access the property, but is not related to being successful or failed. As long as a request is not explicitly failed it is regarded as successfully.

Derrell, I think qx.io2 is a bit better. Especially as all the cross-browser magic is already done in qx.bom.Request. It makes it more complex when a code mix cross-browser logic and class-logic in one file. This is not the case with qx.io2.HttpRequest. It still needs further fine-tuning and testing, but I think it&#39;s a good start.</thetext>
