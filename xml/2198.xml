            <thetext>It would be great if there would be a TitledBorder decorator because that is a very commonly used ui component which is pressent in most toolkits. I have created a simple one for a project by extending qx.ui.decoration.Beveled. This is not the best solution and many things are quick&#39;n&#39;dirty because I did not know things like how to find the parent&#39;s background color (or this parent&#39;s if the parent has none). I can post the code here, but I think for one with some widget development knowledge it&#39;s a matter of very little time to reimplement it in a clean way.</thetext>

            <thetext>Hi, Michael. Just to make sure there isn&#39;t a misunderstanding: Aren&#39;t you looking for features the groupbox already provides?? See http://qooxdoo.org/documentation/widget/groupbox

            <thetext>As far as I can see, a titled border is called group box in the context of qooxdoo. So I close the bug was worksforme. If you disagree, just reopen and let me know what I&#39;m missing.</thetext>
