            <thetext>Are there any plans to implement this feature in the near future? If not, could a developer give me some hints how I would go about doing it myself?

I tried to replicate the drag/drop behavior found in the List demo, but I think the events are not even generated because the underlying widget is a button, is that right?</thetext>

            <thetext>No, we don&#39;t have any plans to get that done any time soon. But if you want to take care of it, feel free to file a pull request on github. We would be happy about it.
As a hint: The drag &amp; drop API should be available on every widget, even on buttons. Still, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to work because I never tried it on buttons. I simple check if it works basically on buttons could give you the initial answer and a better knowledge of the API itself.</thetext>
