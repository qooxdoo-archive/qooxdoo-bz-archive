            <thetext>I can not register on http://qooxdoo.org/forum. Every time I try to register, I&#39;m getting &quot;The validation code did not match the picture&quot;. Tried it many times, pretty sure I recognize and type the verification code correctly.</thetext>

            <thetext>This is an external service we use called nabble. We only supply the mailing list to this service where you should be abel to register: 
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/qooxdoo-devel

Maybe you should get in touch with the support guys at nabble to solve that problem as we can&#39;t do much about it: http://support.nabble.com/</thetext>

            <thetext>I made it work for me, and now I&#39;d like to share the details with you. Feel free to close the bug again, if you still think nothing can or should be done on your side.

If I open http://qooxdoo.org/forum in my browser and try to post something to the forum (mailing list), it does not work. All attempts to log in or register fail. However if I then right-click somewhere in the middle of the page, and choose &quot;This Frame&quot; and then &quot;Show Only This Frame&quot; (I&#39;m using Firefox), then everything immediately starts working as expected.

Also if I go directly to http://qooxdoo.678.n2.nabble.com/, everything also works fine.

The http://qooxdoo.org/community page provides the  http://qooxdoo.org/forum link to the Nabble interface to your mailing list. I suggest you to change it to point to http://qooxdoo.678.n2.nabble.com/ instead.</thetext>

            <thetext>Ah, so the iframe is the root cause of the issue. Strange but you suggestion is valid that we should not link to a not working page. Will keep that issue and see if we simply change the link.</thetext>

            <thetext>Just talked to the team and we decided to get rid of the frame and link directly to the nabble forum.</thetext>

            <thetext>Just gave it another try and tried to register me and that worked in the frame without a problem. So maybe nabble already fixed that issue but anyway, I close that bug as we won&#39;t change anything as its working as it is.</thetext>
