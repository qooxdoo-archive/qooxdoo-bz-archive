            <thetext>Hi,

It would be nice to add a new class in the qx.ui.form package that allows dealing with big lists. For instance, dealing with countries lists is really inefficient using the current implementation. 

The main problem is qx.ui.list.List doesn&#39;t implement the IForm and the IModel interfaces.

Best,

Benoît.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report. But I think it would be much easier to add those two interfaces to the existing list.List instead of creating a third widget. :)</thetext>

&gt; interfaces to the existing list.List instead of creating a third widget. :)

I agree with you but I wonder if it&#39;s then suitable in terms of namespace. 
I mean that the qx.ui.list.List is a virtual generic widget, not necessarily related to the form namespace. It&#39;s only the &quot;semantic use&quot; that makes it linked to a form or not. 

Thus, if it implements directly the iForm interface, I feel it should then be included in qx.ui.form... But maybe I&#39;m just too much purist :)</thetext>

But it still can be used as such. ;)

The tree also implements that interface and is not in the from namespace. So I don&#39;t see a problem here. :)</thetext>

Then I suppose it&#39;s OK :) - by extension, I guess the new VirtualTree widget implementation could be enhanced in the same way too... but it&#39;s for another bug report ;)</thetext>
