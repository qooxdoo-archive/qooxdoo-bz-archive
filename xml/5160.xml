            <thetext>Things I have tried so far:

Helped:
* Set the MinHeight to the viewport height during transition -&gt; helped on some devices
* made sure that offsetHeight / offsetWidth is not called during animation 
* made sure that no DOM updates were made during animation (app code only)

Not sure:
* Used -webkit-animation-fill-mode: forwards; to persist the last frame of the animation -&gt; sounds reasonable
* z-index: the page that is moved in, gets a higher z-index than the page that is moved out

Did not help:
* Used display &quot;none /block&quot; instead of adding / removing pages to dom</thetext>

Correction:
* Set the MinHeight OF THE PAGE to the viewport height during transition -&gt; helped on some devices

Update:

Helped:
* Set the background color / img of the body and page DIVs the same (helped on iOS / iPad)</thetext>

            <thetext>Seems like Google managed to make transitions even worse! When we have tested Android 4.0 last November we hoped that the animations were only broken because it was a demo device. Now we have the current version of the Galaxy Nexus and still animations are broken with Android 4.0.2. Any tests to improve the current behavior were without success.

Reviewed all common mobile frameworks as well - seems they have all the same problems.

See jquery-mobile bug for this as well:

Just found out that for Android 4.0 page transitions are alright when using phonegap and hardware acceleration is disabled. Just make sure that in AndroidManifest.xml &lt;application android:hardwareAccelerated=&quot;false&quot; is set (or just remove the attribute completely). So it seems the android browser is using the hardware acceleration, which is breaking the transitions.</thetext>
