See the above URL for a demonstration of the issue.

When tables are initialized, they have no focus. getFocusedRow and getFocusedColumn both return null, as there is no focused item.

After a focus has been set, whether by automation or user intervention, getFocusedRow and getFocusedColumn return the focused cell, like one would expect.

However: When one calls resetCellFocus(), instead of the table becoming unfocused, as it was when it was initialized, cell (0,0) is drawn as though it currently has focus (it seems that row 0 does not have the focus state appearance, though). calling getFocusedRow returns null, but calling getFocusedColumn returns 0.

The expected behavior is that no cell on the table appear to have focus, and that both getFocusedRow and getFocusedColumn return null, as they did when the table was first created.</thetext>
