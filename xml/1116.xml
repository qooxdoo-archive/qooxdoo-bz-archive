            <thetext>- I&#39;ve translated and created an framework/source/translation/pt_BR.po. I&#39;m selecting &quot;pt_BR&quot; in my application but it hasn&#39;t changed the &quot;1 of 1000 rows&quot; (english) in a table I&#39;ve created. 

- I remember seeing this as a hard codded string in the code. So that would make this a bug. The string needs to be converted to a constant so that it can be swapped with language translations take place.</thetext>

            <thetext>That is strange. The relevant code looks like this and the strings should be translatable:

        if (rowCount &gt; 0)
        {
          if (selectedRowCount == 0) {
            text = this.trn(&quot;one row&quot;, &quot;%1 rows&quot;, rowCount, rowCount);
          } else {
            text = this.trn(&quot;one of one row&quot;, &quot;%1 of %2 rows&quot;, rowCount, selectedRowCount, rowCount);
          }
        }
        
        
 Does it still not work for you? Maybe we have a regression in the string extraction code.</thetext>

Noup, but I&#39;m pretty sure now that it is not a bug. I know for sure that my locale is being selected, but that string isn&#39;t being translated.

Having the pt_BR.po in qooxdoo/framework/source/translation is all that it need to work?

I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m missing to &quot;register&quot; that locale somewhere.</thetext>

            <thetext>You have to select the locale in the config.json file. Can you post this question to the mailing list? I guess others are interested in this topic as well. I&#39;ll ask Thomas to post a description how to do it. He knows these generator topics better.</thetext>

            <thetext>This question is already there, title: [0.8] Translation

Thank you</thetext>
