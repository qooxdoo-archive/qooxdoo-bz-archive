            <thetext>This is rather a usability suggestion than an actual bug.

In a multiwindow environment a modal window should be modal within the scope of application. In QX it&#39;s modal in the scope of the whole environment (Web page). The fact that application A (QXWindow A) displayed an alert should not influence user&#39;s interaction with application B (QXWindow B). The case of an alert is pretty simple, but if a modal window is of more complex content and requires a reasonable amount of user&#39;s time and attention it may be very inconvenient for them to be to forced to work on that modal content in order to get access to the rest of the applications (QXWindows).

Of course system-wide modal windows is a very nice thing to have. In Windows, system messages are displayed in always-on-top windows. I have never seen a window that would block access to Windows shell. The always-on-top windows may come handy. I think in a Web environment, the &quot;block-access-to-shell&quot; windows are also needed. One example of usage could the &quot;Lock Workstation&quot; feature -- a login window is blocking access to all the opened applications.</thetext>
