            <thetext>At runtime you get the error &quot;qx.core.Assert undefined&quot; when creating a build 
version with setting qx.debug=on. This is reproduceable in the gui skeleton.

This is a fork of bug#2188, with relevant comments copied over.</thetext>

            <thetext>Fabian&#39;s comment explains what changed. This affects the qx.debug=on setting  
case. It seems that a &#39;use&#39; requirement changes into a &#39;require&#39; requirement,  
which causes the issue. Adding #require in qx.lang.Object might lead to  
circular dependencies. Have to investigate this.</thetext>

            <thetext>Fabian commented:

&quot;I have added some assertions to qx.lang.Object, which introduces a dependency 
to qx.core.Assert. Since these checks are only in the source version it makes 
sense that turning qx.debug off doesn&#39;t have this problem.&quot;</thetext>

            <thetext>This turns out to be a case of the static initializer problem (bug#1455), so 
I&#39;m closing this as duplicate. Please see #1455 for all general information 
concerning this issue. Here I will only include some information that is 
specific to Petr&#39;s qxbuild project where the bug showed up.

The general work-around is to influence the order of the classes in the 
compiled output by tweaking the &quot;include&quot; key in the config.json. The problem 
with qxbuild is that it has no own classes and primarily includes qx.*. I 
haven&#39;t found a way to prepend some class from the framework that would have 
the desired effect, as usually custom classes have in an application. Sorry, 
Petr, you might have to fiddle with this on your own. Maybe you have to supply 
a minimal custom class to overcome it.

            <thetext>NB: I will supply a qxbuild version in qooxdoo-contrib/Bugs/2249. Here are the 
steps to reproduce the issue from the provided qxbuild.zip, with FF under Linux:

    - unzip
    - config.json: 
      - adapt QOOXDOO_PATH
      - fix.py -&gt; ./fix.py
    - chmod +x fix.py
    - generate compile-qx
    - index.html:
      - &quot;qx.mode&quot; : &quot;debug&quot;
    - firefox build/index.html
    - firebug: &quot;qx.core.Assert is undefined&quot;</thetext>
