            <thetext>As stated in the IE8 blog [1], and re-emphasized again recently [2], CSS expressions are to be abandoned in Internet Explorer 8. This sort of trickery has two main disadvantages: it&#39;s proprietary (IE-only) and it seems to be a source of slow down [3].

By running a search in the qooxdoo sources, I noticed that (at least) this is used for the Window log appended:
 * legacy-branch: qooxdoo/frontend/framework/source/class/qx/log/appender/Window.js (line 283);
 * trunk: framework/source/class/qx/legacy/log/appender/Window.js (line 281).

It would be a good idea removing this (and double check for more) hanging CSS expression from both trunk and legacy branch, not only to improve IE8 support but for a potential debug performance improvement for IE users. :-)

As a side note, bug 1434 and bug 2024 seem to be somehow related, although targeted at 0.8.x only.

            <thetext>I could only found the CSS expressions in &quot;qx.log.appender.Window&quot; (0.7.x).
In qx 0.8 we never use CSS expressions.

@Andreas
Should we really remove the CSS expressions in 0.7.x, because the expressons are valid when it is rendered in Quirks or IE7 mode? And qx 0.7.x is only running in Quirks mode, isn&#39;t it? </thetext>

&gt; In qx 0.8 we never use CSS expressions.

Well, my quick find-in-files only seemed to show a CSS expression in framework/source/class/qx/legacy/log/appender/Window.js (see comment 0) -- so at least there&#39;s one! ;-)  This single CSS expression exists for both trunk and legacy, I&#39;m not sure if there are more.

Given the release of IE8 today [1], this may become more important as the user base increases...

 Helder

            <thetext>Yes, but it is only in the legacy path (trunk) and this is only for migration from 0.7.x to 0.8. So the main code from 0.8 isn&#39;t affected. That was my 	intention with &quot;In qx 0.8 we never use CSS expressions.&quot;, sorry for my confused comment.</thetext>

            <thetext>I don&#39;t think this is a real issue, as it only affects legacy 0.7.x code that is not able to properly run in IE8 standards mode anyway. Once the legacy part of the 0.8.x code base is gone, which is there only for intermediate migration as Chris explained, there shouldn&#39;t be a CSS expression left.

Thanks Helder for pointing out this potential issue.</thetext>

It&#39;s reasonable to assume this is abandoned for 0.8.x but... Should this be abandoned for the legacy branch also?

I&#39;d vote for changing the issue&#39;s scope for 0.7 (as it affects all 0.7 releases), with target set for 0.7.5 (to call for attention for the next release) and &quot;Hardware&quot; set to IE (although IE8 will have real issues, the performance degradation affects all IE versions).

As the logger class is (usually) only used while in development, the only affected by this should be developers using IE, so I&#39;m leaving this untouched -- please reopen if you believe many are using IE for development... ;-)</thetext>
