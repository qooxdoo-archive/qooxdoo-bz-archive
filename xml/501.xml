            <thetext>The description of each demo in the demo viewer is only available as a tooltip on the tree items (or in the source code of the demo).

It should be shown in the viewer panel along with the tabs. Either show it above the tabs or alternatively show it on its own tab (&quot;Description&quot;). This allows for massive expansion of the description in the future, maybe with HTML, which would make the demo browser much more friendly and very useful as a learning resource.

            <thetext>@Daniel one should look into putting back such a user-friendly feature into the current code base. If it is not too elaborate, and despite the fact that the demobrowser could certainly deserve a major rewrite (e.g. improving demo integration/performance or playground features). Good pragmatic ideas?

            <thetext>Although this is a long-standing bug, the requirement is as actual as ever. 
Meanwhile, even the tooltips have vanished, so there is no more description for 
the demos at all. This makes it very tedious to grasp the gist of a demo, know 
what to exercise and which result to expect, even for core developers if they 
are not the author of the demo, let alone normal users. I entirely agree wit 
Hugh and Fabian, and even 2-line descriptions of a demo would make them 
dramatically more usable. I totally endorse this idea and have up&#39;ed prio in 
the hopes that it gets targeted soon. It would be enough for a start to create 
the general infrastructure, like a tagged string (e.g. top-level &quot;var 
DESCRIPTION = &quot;...&quot;) or an application method (&quot;getDescription : function() 
{...}&quot;) that will be used by the GUI to integrate the description. And then, 
step-wise, add descriptions to demos (where even I could help).</thetext>
