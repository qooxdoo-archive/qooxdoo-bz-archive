            <thetext>The included documentation in the SDK zip cannot be used offline, as it has lots of references to outside CSSs, and some links point directly to the online version (most visible, on the index.html). If you cannot use it offline, I don&#39;t see including it useful at all...</thetext>

            <thetext>YEs, I&#39;m talking aboud documentation/manual. I don&#39;t think apiViewer is affected, but haven&#39;t tried. A quick grep doesn&#39;t show any outside css link.</thetext>

            <thetext>I&#39;ve talked with Martin, and we think we should add the CSS files to the SDK.

(This would also point to maintaining them in the normal qooxdoo git repo (not aside from it); would make their maintenance and deployment to the SDK easier for us; the same rational probably applies to the (q) plugins used at qooxdoo.org).</thetext>

            <thetext>That&#39;s a good idea, of course, but don&#39;t forget to also fix the absolute links inside the documentation</thetext>

            <thetext>The manual now uses local fonts, style sheets and script files, so should be 
self-contained and fully usable on an offline machine.

As for external links (i.e. hyperlinks in the manual that go to non-local web 
sites), I think you&#39;ll have to live with the fact that they don&#39;t work while 
being offline. I don&#39;t want to remove those, as they are essential pointers to 
further material (e.g. standards or reference sites like W3C or Mozilla, or 
online demos that illustrate the manual&#39;s material like at our demo.qooxdoo.org 
site). But I also see no way to easily create a version of the manual where 
those links are eliminated, together with all the contextual text. But I think 
that&#39;s all quite acceptable, as the manual is in itself complete and all 
internal links work as expected, so there is plenty to read ;-).</thetext>
