&gt; TH is fully aware of the bug&#39;s context and does not require any additional info.

He might be (now) but what if someone other is interested in what went wrong and if he has the same issue? Bug are also public documentation and should be reproducible at any time.</thetext>

Mustafa talked to me first, but left into holidays without creating a bug. The 
bug title together with the description is actually enough to reproduce the 
issue (provided you also rename the file). After that the Generator does 
nothing, meaning it doesn&#39;t complain about an now unknown reference in another 
class that goes to the old class name.</thetext>

            <thetext>Unknown symbols are now represented internally as foo.Bar# rather than foo#Bar 
(as this split of &#39;class&#39; and &#39;attribute&#39; is entirely guesswork for unknown 
symbols). As a consequence custom.Foo is no longer covered up by a known 
&#39;custom&#39; namespace.
