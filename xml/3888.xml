            <thetext>I created a scroll container like this:

------------------------
this._scrollContainer = new qx.ui.container.Scroll();
this._scrollContainer.set({
    maxHeight: 300,
    allowStretchY: true
})
------------------------

The expected behavior would have been to resize the container until it&#39;s child gets bigger than 300px.
This does not occur. The Scroll container keeps it&#39;s 200px default height no matter what.

            <thetext>Guille, I can&#39;t reproduce your issue, have a look at the playground example:
http://tinyurl.com/2f9ekge

Maybe, you are using a layout which doesn&#39;t support it. Please reopen the bug if you have an example which shows the issue with a layout which should consider the maxHeight.</thetext>

            <thetext>Well in the playground, just set the height/width of the child-widget to 100:

-----------------------
var widget1 = new qx.ui.core.Widget().set({
  height: 100,
  width: 100,
  backgroundColor: &quot;red&quot;,
  allowShrinkY : false,
  allowShrinkX : false,
});
-----------------------

The expected behavior would be that the scroll container resizes itself to 100*100 px. But it keeps its 300*300px... For some reason the child widget even grows to the scrollcontainer size of 300*300.</thetext>

            <thetext>Now I understood what you want to arrive and this is not possible, because we have no layout layer for this.

&gt; The expected behavior would be that the scroll container resizes itself to
&gt; 100*100 px. 
No, it can&#39;t shrink, because the size of the scroll container depends on the container he is added and not on his content. In the playground example the scroll container is added to a container with a VBox layout. The VBox layout always tries to give the max space to his children. In the example the VBox layout grows the scroll container until the max values are achieved.

&gt; But it keeps its 300*300px... 
Yes, it will always keep the size when the VBox layout has more than 300*300px.

&gt; For some reason the child widget even grows to the scrollcontainer size of
&gt; 300*300.
That&#39;s because the scroll container self has a Grow layout for his added content, it always ties to grow or shrink his content to his size. Set allowGrowY and allowGrowX to false, this would avoid the growth. But the scroll container keeps his size from the layout (300*300px).</thetext>

            <thetext>Ok, thank you for explaining.

Still, i think what happens is wrong. What is maxHeight and maxWidth there for? 
It&#39;s confusing to be able to set those properties if they are not used in it&#39;s proper way.. so why have them in the first place?</thetext>
