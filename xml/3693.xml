            <thetext>The Demobrowser has a cluttered path in its &#39;resource&#39; folder:
  
  source/resource/demobrowser/demo/test

Among other things, it contains a file &#39;alphaPNG.png&#39; which is used in a demo 
(Decoration_UseCase). This makes sense as it it is in the &#39;test&#39; package of 
demos.

It contains combined images, which used to be in 
demobrowser/demo/icons/combined (which is also a weird place, as these combined 
images are used by the demobrowser itself, not (just) the demos). It also 
contains input files for the combined images (e.g. &#39;demobrowser_thumb.png&#39;).  
It contains a file &#39;thumbs.png&#39; and &#39;combined/thumbs.png&#39;, which are apparently 
the same. All those images make little sense in this path.

In general, I don&#39;t see a good reason to have normal images in the 
demo-specific &#39;test&#39; path. It should only contain images that pertain 
specifically to the &#39;test&#39; name space of demos. The combined images should be 
at demobrowser/combined, the *_thumb.png&#39;s at demobrowser/. If the paths are 
re-organized, they have to be adatpted in image.json, so the image-combine job 
will continue to function.

            <thetext>Nothing to re-organize here. 

Every image (except the &quot;thumbs.png&quot;) inside the &quot;test&quot; folder is used by the &quot;Decoration_UseCase&quot; demo. The &quot;combined&quot; images are used by the IE browsers at runtime (there are no resource links to those images at the demo source code).
