            <thetext>The &quot;click&quot; event is not fired for a qx.ui.menu.Button in Forefox (tested with 3.6, 5 and 8). You have to use &quot;execute&quot; instead. It is working in Opera 11.50, Chrome 12 and 14 and IE 9.

I think it was still working in 1.4.1.

            <thetext>Can&#39;t get it working with any qooxdoo version, also in 1.4 and 1.3, the click event seems not to be fired.</thetext>

            <thetext>The problem was in the menu buttons itself. It implemented a listener on mouseup which was responsible for hiding the menu. The bad thing about that is, that firefox did not fire an click event after that because the dom element was already gone. A move to the click event to close the menu fixed the problem.

            <thetext>Martin, the deprecation with r28806 does occurs on each button click. This is not the deprecation we need. A application developer gets the deprecation and can&#39;t do nothing against it, because the deprecation occurs due to the own listener in the AbstractButton class. I would propose to remove the listener and check instead that the _onMouseUp method is not overridden from a subclass.

I also think that this fix is nothing for the 1_5_x branch because we change API and this is against our idea from a drop in replacement.</thetext>

            <thetext>Removed the deprecation warning for the branch. In the branch, we should not deprecate anything and thats why i just moved the internal implementation to click (which fixed the issue) and let the onMouseUp handler as it is.

The fix Chris made for the master is good enough so I can just keep it.</thetext>
