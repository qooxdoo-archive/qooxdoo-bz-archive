            <thetext>I&#39;m doing is to create a a form with both form and list controller like the one in this example
http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/demobrowser/#data~FormAndListController.html

Everything worked until I tried to use integer as value for the list : the Item with value 0 can be selected only if it is defined as first element of the array.
If it is in any other position there is no way to select it!

Here it is an example that show the strange behavior
http://tinyurl.com/6hygo89

after commenting out &#39;checkBoxes.reverse() ;&#39;,  Item with value 0 will be selectable

The same happens using &#39;null&#39; instead of 0.
Using both null and 0 works only if null is the first value in the array; but after selecting the value 0 is no more possible to select value &#39;null&#39;</thetext>

            <thetext>I expected it in the first place but could not find it immediately , it was an if condition not handling 0 as value properly:

if (item) { //...

So the selected item was in that case 0 which is false which reseted the selection which is why it worked with the one order. Adding a proper check fixed the whole issue. Also added a unit test to prevent that from happening again!
