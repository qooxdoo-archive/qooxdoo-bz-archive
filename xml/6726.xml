            <thetext>The first line of one of my Javascript files starts with a comment:

/**
  * bla...
  */

Using 84ba43c, the generator gives me this error:

Expected &quot;{&quot; (at char 15), (line:1, col:16)

And nothing else.

Apart from this bug, I have to say I have really spent way to much time debugging the internals of the generator. One of the main problem is that these sort of errors do not say anything about the file being processed (FWIW, in this particular case, verbose mode did point me to the file, though due to the strange error message and strange column number this wasn&#39;t clear to me).

This is the traceback that I made it output:

            <thetext>This is fairly new stuff [1], so issues are not unusual (esp. when it comes to error reporting), but thanks for the report.

[1] http://news.qooxdoo.org/new-lint-module(In reply to comment #2)

&gt; The first line of one of my Javascript files starts with a comment:
&gt; 
&gt; /**
&gt;   * bla...
&gt;   */

Looking at the stack trace the issue happens in a function that parses &#39;@param&#39; lines, so I suppose &quot;bla&quot; expands to &quot;@param ...&quot; at one point. It would be helpful if you could include the entire comment (or stripped down to the point where it still reproduces the issue).

&gt; Apart from this bug, I have to say I have really spent way to much time
&gt; debugging the internals of the generator.

Then don&#39;t do it :-).

&gt; One of the main problem is that these
&gt; sort of errors do not say anything about the file being processed (FWIW, in
&gt; this particular case, verbose mode did point me to the file, though due to the
&gt; strange error message and strange column number this wasn&#39;t clear to me).

Error reporting will improve once the actual functionality of the new code has settled. So keep this bug open until then.

&gt; 
&gt; This is the traceback that I made it output:

            <thetext>I should probably add that you can work around the issue by fixing the syntax

&gt; Just being curious: You &quot;made it output&quot; using the -s switch of the generator,
&gt; didn&#39;t you?!

No, I was using traceback.print_exc() :) Good to know there is a switch.

I should say that I have wrapped Qooxdoo&#39;s generator.py within my own CLI interface, so I don&#39;t get to see the full help; my own fault.</thetext>

&gt; This is a comment that causes the issue:
&gt; 
&gt;   /**
&gt;    *

&gt; 

So, yes, these are indeed syntax errors in the @param parameters. Fix them and you should be fine.</thetext>
