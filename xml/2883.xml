            <thetext>generator.action.Locale.getPackageData() seems to have room for performance 
improvements:

- for each package, .po files from the accompanying libraries are re-read and 
re-parsed by polib

- for each package, the PoFiles map is re-calculated</thetext>

            <thetext>Some improvements made. Measurements showed that most time is spent in polib&#39;s 
functions, particularly polib.POFile.merge() and polib.POFile.find(). 
Substituted usage of both methods in Locale.py with own methods, merging 
entries by hand from the .po file into the generated .pot file; and using an 
enhanced &#39;find&#39; (indexFind) which uses a pre-fabricated dict for msgid&#39;s (who 
had thought that so much time is lost in Python&#39;s built-in &#39;getattr&#39; 
function!). Measurements afterwards indicate time savings of above 85% in a big 
project with lots of libraries and .po files, which would be good.

            <thetext>Closing this for the moment, as I don&#39;t think we should push further. There is 
still room for a possible improvement, concerning reading and parsing of .po 
files (each involved .po file is opened and re-read for every package), but 
this would require substantial re-coding of the control flow between 
CodeGenerator.py and Locale.py, and the net benefit is unclear.

(Sketch: Create an array of pot files, one for each package, upfront; then when 
looping through the locales, open each .po file only once, and extract all 
interesting entries for *every* pot file in the array, instead of just one).</thetext>
