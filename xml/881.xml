            <thetext>Code infrastructure for including mixins already exists. Unclear is the life cycle of a mixin and where to get a mixin that is defined in a different class.

(Failing) Tests have been created and are set to be ignored until a concept for reliably including mixins is found.</thetext>

            <thetext>QXDT was abandoned in an early experimental state, issues unlikely to be fixed. If you&#39;re interested to work on qooxdoo support for Eclipse JSDT, let us know.
