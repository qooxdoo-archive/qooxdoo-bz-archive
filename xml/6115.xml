            <thetext>I&#39;ve been trying to profile my app and found that there is a surprising amount of activity caused by qx.event.Idle – if I start my app, wait 10 seconds, and then run the Firebug profiler for the next 10 seconds I get 9,000 function calls logged and 13.9% of the time profiled is spent in qx.event.Manager.dispatchEvent because qx.event.Idle has a timer running.

The time taken up by Idle was only a few milliseconds but I found the extra output misleading and got in the way of what I was trying to debug in my own code.  Looking further it turns out that qx.event.Idle is not being used in my app, i.e. nothing has registered a listener for it&#39;s &quot;interval&quot; event so there was no need for it to have a timer and have those 9,000 calls.

I&#39;ve modified qx.event.Idle so that it only creates a timer if there is at least one listener (and removes the timer when the last listener goes) and the profiler now records no actions for the same test.  

Please can this be reviewed for inclusion in the trunk?  Here&#39;s the pull request for github:
