            <thetext>When trying to override the run key of a job with &quot;=run&quot; the elements of its 
list value are not properly adapted when this job is imported by another one.

I.e. importing application.json as &quot;appconf&quot; with jobA with 

  &quot;=run&quot; : [&quot;jobB&quot;, &quot;jobC&quot;]

will not result in the fully expanded job appconf::jobA with

  &quot;run&quot; : [&quot;appconf::jobB&quot;, &quot;appconf::jobC&quot;]

which leads to errors.</thetext>

            <thetext>Fixed with r18353.

The issue needed two steps to resolve:

First, on imports routines where checking &quot;run&quot; keys, in order to adapt them to 
import name prefixes. But &quot;=run&quot; didn&#39;t match &quot;run&quot;, so they failed to work on 
this key. The solution here was to move the call to Config.fixJobsTags() away 
from a late point in the processing in generator.py, to a much earlier point 
(actually, when the config is read in the Config() constructor). This made 
these routines work again.

Second, the &quot;__override__&quot; key that came from resolving &quot;=run&quot; needed to be 
treated on job merges (during extend resolution). Previously, this key was not 
treated at all in the parent job, so protected jobs in the parent went into the 
receiving job as unprotected. This had also to be changed. Now, parent keys 
that are added as new to the receiving job will carry over their protection 
status. Existing keys will not change their protection status, so that an 
unprotected key may receive the contents of a protected key in the parent, the 
result being still unprotected for further extends. That seems like a sensible 
treatment, given the fact that protection should work &quot;upwards&quot; towards the own 
parents, but not &quot;downwards&quot; towards jobs consuming this one.</thetext>
