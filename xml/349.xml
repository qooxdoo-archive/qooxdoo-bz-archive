            <thetext>Steps to reproduce:

In this demo, 
   http://demo.qooxdoo.org/current/sample/html/example/Table_1.html
click the button at the right side of te header to hide any column.

The following exception is triggered:

016952: Could not dispatch event of type &quot;visibilityChanged&quot;: TypeError -  this._columnDataArr[$0] has no properties

It could be a bug of the new qx.ui.table.ResizeTableColumnModel</thetext>

            <thetext>This problem was fixed last week.  Please try the version in SVN.

            <thetext>After having tested the latest version (7030) from http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/qooxdoo/branches/legacy_0_6_x/qooxdoo/frontend/framework/source/class/qx/ui/table/?sortby=date#dirlist, the problem seems to go on.

Here is the problem:

            <thetext>With current code (after the fix of last week), I can not make it fail no matter what I try.  I guess you&#39;ll need to provide ample detail of what fails to allow me to find the problem.  I suspect, however, that there&#39;s something wrong with your build process.  Try, from the frontend directory:

  make distclean
  make source

then load the source version of Table_1.html in your browser:

file:///path_to_qooxdoo/frontend/application/sample/source/html/example/Table_1.html

If it still doesn&#39;t work, please reopen this bug and provide detail enough for me to replicate the problem.</thetext>

            <thetext>You&#39;re right, it is solved, as long as you don&#39;t use the setTableColumnModel().
If used, the visibilityChangedPre event isn&#39;t registered.
It would be nice if the method setTableColumnModel() were removed, to avoid confusion.

I discovered this after debugging.

What do you think?</thetext>

            <thetext>Since it is never legal to change the table column model once it is established, I had added a setOnlyOnce:true characteristic to the tableColumnModel property.  Unfortunately, that no longer seems to work (or I am using it incorrectly).  I&#39;m reopening this bug and will, at some point in the future, determine how to either make that characteristic work properly, or throw an error from the _modifyTableColumnModel() function if oldProp != null.</thetext>

            <thetext>setOnlyOnce was a property only supported by &quot;fast&quot; properties used in events etc. This was never available for normal events.

I would suggest to add a check to the modifier/apply-routine. Just check if the old value is defined and throw an exception should be enough.

Moved to 0.7.4</thetext>

Now an exception is raised if the model is set a second time and the API doc is updated.</thetext>
