            <thetext>A performance of a rendering script processing of SelectBox can be significantly and quite easily improved by postponing list initialization to the first access of the list component (either programaticaly or by user interaction - e.g. by focusing).

From my own experience with QooXDoo I know that when we postpone the initialization of an embedded list widget, the main SelectBox component can be ready much soon (e.g.: in IE8 the script of selectbox initialization is done about 70% quicker when compared to full (not postponed) initialization; in chrome or firefox the improvement is about 40%). Of course, the results can vary, but improvement will be still significant. I&#39;ve had only few list items in selectbox and not a big number.

Just think about situation when you need to have a lot of selectboxes in your application...

I think that such scenario can be used also for other widgets and so it doesn&#39;t relate only to SelectBox.</thetext>

            <thetext>Did you see the virtual widgets? There is also a virtual select box which only renders the widgets in the scroll pane. That improves rendering time as well.</thetext>

            <thetext>Hello, yes I know the virtual widgets, but still I think that some improvement can be done with non-virtual widgets as well (especially with SelectBox).
