Patch for GridDiv.js (1.4)

This is a follow up to http://bugzilla.qooxdoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2962 which is now fixed.

Initially Qooxdoo did not allow absent images for slicing jobs and in the Decorator classes. I think now the tooling part has improved and Qx is perfectly capable of slicing a base image into less than 9 images (for instance, it is possible to have an absent top-left, top and top-right images).

However in the framework classes the decorator classes still do not allow empty images which is very problematic. I have a patch that we use internally to solve the problem for GridDiv.js. However browsers supporting CSS3 use the class BorderImage so a patch needs to be written for this class as well. Currently internally we have disabled the use of BorderImage for all browsers since we absolutely need to be able to have absent images.

Due to other developments, we now need to support BorderImage pretty quickly so we could try to come up with a patch ourselves if given the right pointers.

(Note: the attached patch also moves some variable from private (__) to protected (_). This would be a welcome change too because we needed to subclass GridDiv and to access those variables.</thetext>

            <thetext>I have to agree that this would be a very welcome feature. But as always, I can&#39;t promise that this is going into the release. We&#39;re give it a try and hope to get it done within the next two weeks.

@Alex: Please check the patch and give me feedback.</thetext>

            <thetext>@Jean-Noel
Can you briefly describe in what use cases you need this behaviour?

The thing is, that the GridDiv is perfectly usable for this, but the 
BorderImage does not support this. E.g. you leave the top-right edge emtpy. The 
BorderImage only shows the whole image and not parts of it.
In this case you need to adjust the borderImage itself.

The main problem here is that we need an equal implementation for both GridDiv 
and BorderImage.</thetext>

Our use case is simple: we have a Decorator with images at top, right and bottom but not at the left edge.</thetext>

&gt; bottom but not at the left edge.
Okay. And this is exactly an use case where you have to use a customized image as BorderImage, because the BorderImage cannot leave out one edge as the GridDiv can.

I think it is better to make all necessary member variables protected (already the case in current trunk) to let you create an own decorator. For the borderImage it would be necessary to create an own image anyway and this would be possible with the current implementation.

I would suggest to *not* include your patch in the framework and implement an own decorator instead, because we won&#39;t be able to cover the same appearance with the two implementations. There has always to be a custom solution for your case.

If this is okay for you I would close  this bug report as &quot;WONTFIX&quot;.</thetext>

&gt; Hello. To be honest I don&#39;t understand anything about what you are saying. 
Please 
&gt; explain in more details: what do you mean by &quot;custom image&quot;? I guess the 
decorator uses 
&gt; 9 (or less) images, as the GridDiv does...
With &quot;custom image&quot; I mean the image you have to use for the borderImage 
decorator.

The CSS3 border image uses 1single image to do the same as the GridDiv with 9 
slices. So it is *not* possible to leave out one or more images with the 
BorderImage implementation. This is only possible with the GridDiv 
implementation.

This is the reason why I think it is better to leave out the patch and 
implement a custom decorator (in your application code).

See http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/#border-images for more details on 
CSS3 border image.</thetext>

We are currently using this setting (all slices with 0 px) and this ends up in one big image which is used. 
The slices are used to setup different regions within the image. If you set all slices to 0 one big picture is used.

As a result you have to used *different* images for the GridDiv and the CSS3 BorderImage decorator.

One complete image which can be sliced up physically in 9 parts for the GridDiv decorator. With your patch you would be able to leave out some of the 9 parts of the image. For example you leave out the upper edges at the right and left.

On the other side for the BorderImage decorator you have create one image which has already left out these two edges to be able to show it as a complete image. 

This solution is possible, but it is rather generic. And that&#39;s the reason why I think it&#39;s better suited for application code.</thetext>

            <thetext>Ha, I think I got it now. The problem for you is to be able to support both the GridDiv and the CSS3 BorderImage with a single image.

However, what I dont understand is that even with images that dont have a 0-width, this is already the case (eg, you have a single image for BorderImage and 9 images for the GridDiv).

So I still fail to see what bothers you. Plus, I dont understand when you say

&quot;We are currently using this setting (all slices with 0 px) and this ends up in
one big image which is used. &quot;

If you use only 0px slices, I dont see the point of using BorderImage (and fail to see how it could work).

Btw, maybe it would be faster if we had a conversation on the phone (or IRC or...)</thetext>

&gt; Ha, I think I got it now. The problem for you is to be able to support both 
the GridDiv and the CSS3 
&gt; BorderImage with a single image.
Yes, the problem is that both implementations have to end up with the same 
result. If the browser is capable of using CSS3 borderImage it is used 
*transparently* and if the browser is an older one the GridDiv is automatically 
chosen as fallback. 

&gt; However, what I dont understand is that even with images that dont have a 
0-width, this is already the 
&gt; case (eg, you have a single image for BorderImage and 9 images for the 
GridDiv).
&gt; 
&gt; So I still fail to see what bothers you. 
As I mentioned above it is necessary to get the same result with both 
implementations. Your proposed patch only addresses the GridDiv decorator and 
for the CSS3 borderImage there is technically no solution (at least none of my 
knowledge).

&gt; Plus, I dont understand when you say
&gt; 
&gt; &quot;We are currently using this setting (all slices with 0 px) and this ends up 
in
&gt; one big image which is used. &quot;
&gt; 
&gt; If you use only 0px slices, I dont see the point of using BorderImage (and 
fail to see how it could work).
We can reduce the number of images from 9 to 1 which reduces the number of 
network requests. This is a performance gain.

Anyway, I&#39;m moving this issue to milestone 1.6, since this won&#39;t make it into 
1.5 (code freeze is tomorrow morning). Feel free to comment and if you agree 
with my explanations I&#39;ll close this issue.</thetext>
