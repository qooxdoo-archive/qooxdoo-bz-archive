This must be wrong because it does not take 5 ms. It takes about maybe 1 min in this computer...

That comes back to the previous discussion in a bug report about how to display times and what is relevant...</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report Steffan. Thomas should check if thats really possible. I have also seen such times which might be confusing.

It takes 0.05 seconds which are 50 ms but still a questionable value.

&gt; times and what is relevant...
No, not really. We talked already about that and we are not doing it again.</thetext>

It is perfectly fine. If you take in the whole picture (rather than making assumptions about the last output line), you would see that a message like this is printed *after every individual job* that is executed during the &#39;generate.py&#39; run. In the case of the &#39;test&#39; master job, these are at least 6 sub-jobs in total, the last one being a simple file copy job. And 5 centiseconds is a very appropriate duration for that.

And before you start wondering, timing the leaf jobs is by design. If you wanted a grand-total of the entire &#39;generate.py&#39; run, this is trivially available with e.g. the time command, &#39;time generate.py test&#39;.</thetext>

            <thetext>You must be working with really small &quot;generations&quot; as the problem does not seem to be real to you.

A nice summary like most all serious &quot;compilers&quot; give is a must!</thetext>

Steffan, you got your opinion, we have ours. But there is no reason to give us a lesson what serious compilers must have and as a side note telling us that we don&#39;t have a serious compiler. We want to keep a professional attitude so please keep yours too.</thetext>
