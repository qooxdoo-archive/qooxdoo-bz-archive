            <thetext>when multiple qx windows are open, clicking on a deactivated window
activates it, i.e. brings it to front and sets the active appearance
state.
However, when clicking on a qx.ui.treefullcontrol.Tree inside a
deactivated window, the activation does not work. It appears that Tree
and TreeFolder install event listeners for the mousedown event that
intercept the event propagation.

When the line

   e.stopPropagation();

in the _onmousedown method in TreeFolder is uncommented, the window
activation works again, but then the clicked item is not selected anymore.</thetext>

            <thetext>Fixed in revision 8805.

Hint: The problem is that the old implementation used stopPropagation to stop the tree selection progressing through parent nodes. This behavior also stopped the window activation.

I&#39;ve removed the stopPropagation called and internally remember that the event was processed by the tree.

Under Windows(TM) the focus on the Window comes first and then the click inside it. I am really interested how we can solve this in the way Windows does, because currently the tree folder/file is selected first and then the Window activation follows.</thetext>
