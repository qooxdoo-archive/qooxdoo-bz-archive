            <thetext>While supporting, documenting, maintaining and testing Rhino support isn&#39;t such a big deal, I would promote for dropping it. Everything that makes us leaner makes us faster. 

Why dropping Rhino?

* The latest release of Rhino is 1.7R4 from June, 2012 [1] which targets JavaScript 1.7 [2].
* The latest qooxdoo mailing list question for Rhino is from June 2012 [3].
* While pull requests are accepted there seems no real ongoing activity on their GitHub page (only 5 commits in 2013, and no commits in 2014) [4].
* With the rise of Node.js I see no real justification for using Rhino nowadays other than that you&#39;re stuck with using Java.

I think a small note somewhere in the manual in the vain of &quot;... should also work with Rhino, but not officially supported by us ...&quot; is sufficient.</thetext>
