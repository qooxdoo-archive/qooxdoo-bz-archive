            <thetext>Our animations that use qx.bom.AnimationFrame do not work in Firefox 3.6.

This issue is already fixed with the following checkin:
  https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo/commit/02f0a765314f550ea258207806e8a70881272082

But this check-in does not contain any cross-reference to a fixed bug.

Because this issue is already fixed, and I was not able to find an old qooxdoo playground without this fix, I was not able to provide a playground example.

The effect of this bug was that the end-event of the animation is never fired.
I have debugged through the old (faulty) code and noticed that the animation runs endlessly and the variable &quot;time&quot; has always a small value of about 10.

The effects of this bug were big for our application: Our application waits for the end-event of an animation until the startup process of the application continues. Because this end-event is never fired, our application does not run anymore on Firefox 3.6.</thetext>

            <thetext>Thanks for the report. The commit you&#39;re referencing was intentionally a fix for the newest chrome which already uses high resolution time fitten the changed spec. I opened a follow up report for using the high resolution time (bug #7003). 
But this seems to be a different issue because FF3.6 does not support the native requestAnimationFrame [1]. So I need to check whats wrong and see if it could be a general problem when the fallback implementation is used.

            <thetext>I just checked the implementation and do see the bug now, which has in deed been fixed intentionally with the mentioned commit.</thetext>
