            <thetext>For multi-user real-time interaction also events generated on the server should 
be able to affect the client, look here for the idea:

            <thetext>Also keep this in mind:

Network: Beyong http Streaming (=comet) and its bi-directional communications, 
Internet Messaging Bus would bring support to guaranteed message delivery, 
guaranteed order of message delivery, support to once and only once message 
delivery, supports server-initiated communications. As Nexaweb is working on 
the subject and is implied in the  XAP  project which is open for integration 
with other GUI toolkits (Dojo support in XAP is already in the work), some 
answers may come by taking an interesting in a Qooxdoo / XAD combination which 
by could also answer to some of the points mentionned in the previous wish of 
the 8 Ajax evaluation criteria.</thetext>

            <thetext>Also take a look at http://meteorserver.org/browser-techniques/ for cross-browser techniques for this. And note the thread at http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/2006/02/what-else-is-burried-down-in-the-depths-of-
googles-amazing-javascript/ which also discusses some of the pitfalls and solutions. Note in particular that data collects in the transport which must be periodically cleared.

Ideally a socket-like object could be opened onto the server with a data received event and a send() function.

The server requirements in terms of formatting messages could be clearly defined.
