            <thetext>Hi,

I&#39;m not quite sure where to file this as I think it may be an issue with the demobrowser code more than qx.

I thought I had a problem with my code because I used the demo code here in the playground:
http://preview.tinyurl.com/k2al8zd
and I found that the indicator does not appear when you are reordering the list. 

I then tried the demo here:
http://demo.qooxdoo.org/3.5/demobrowser/#ui~DragDrop.html
and it worked.

So I think the generated code has an inconsistency with what is actually running on the demobrowser.

So, in the end I can&#39;t figure out what is causing the indicator to disappear since it works in one place but not the other.</thetext>
