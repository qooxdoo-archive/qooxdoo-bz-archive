            <thetext>Here is one regression in 0.8: moving the qooxdoo lib around is a pain:

In 0.7.x you only had to change the path to where Qooxdoo is installed
in one place. Now you have to change it in 3 places: twice in
config.json and one in generate.py, which is especially ugly IMO.

This is problematic for writing installation instructions of my App (I
can&#39;t force people to install qooxdoo in the exact same folder as I
did). It&#39;s also a pain when you regularly switch qooxdoo versions/branches (currently, I often switch from 0.8 to trunk and back).

Couldn&#39;t the &quot;userland&quot; generate.py get the path to qooxdoo from config.json?
Also I tried to eliminate the extra one in config.json, by having
something like this:

 &quot;let&quot; :
 {
   &quot;QOOXDOO_ROOT&quot; : &quot;../qooxdoo/0.8/&quot;,
   &quot;QOOXDOO_PATH&quot; : &quot;${QOOXDOO_ROOT}/framework&quot;,
 },

 &quot;include&quot; :
 [
   {
     &quot;path&quot; : &quot;${QOOXDOO_ROOT}/tool/data/config/application.json&quot;,
     &quot;as&quot;   : &quot;appconf&quot;
   }
 ],

But apparently the macro system doesn&#39;t work for the &quot;path&quot; key (it&#39;s
not expanded)...</thetext>

            <thetext>Since &#39;let&#39; macros are now usable in &#39;include&#39; config keys, the paths to 
included configs now use where appropriate the QOOXDOO_PATH macro, which has 
been adjusted to point to the installation root (this corresponds to the 
QOOXDOO_ROOT in the bug description).
Addressing the framework library is now done via ${QOOXDOO_PATH}/framework.
So now environments can be switched in config files with the change of a single 
macro :-).

As for generate.py, I&#39;ve also implemented scanning config.json for the 
QOOXDOO_PATH entry, and prefering it over the installation setting. But mind 
this is fragile, as it takes the first lexical occurrence of the macro 
definition, commented out or not, and extracts its value.
