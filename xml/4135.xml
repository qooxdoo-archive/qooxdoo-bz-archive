            <thetext>If the locale is in a part and you try to setLocale without loading the part, setLocale changes the current locale. It means it is not in sync with the actual current locale. This must be corrected so it does not change if the locale part can not be loaded or has not been loaded.</thetext>

            <thetext>This is a good one. setLocale() could check with .getAvailableLocales() whether 
the desired locale is already loaded, and raise an exception if not.</thetext>

            <thetext>I just took a look at the implementation and decided to let it the way it is. There were two reasons: 
1. There is already a warning when an application is set which is not available.
2. The property should reflect the wish which should be set, not whats really set
3. It may be ok to set a locale which is not available if you can live with the fallback

Nevertheless, I have seen that there is a difference between which value is currently set and which value the application developer wants to set. Maybe we should get that straight some day but so long, we live with the warning.</thetext>
