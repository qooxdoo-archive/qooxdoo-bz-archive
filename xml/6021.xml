            <thetext>The manual loading using f.readSync prevents debugging node.js applications in cloud9.

The following pull request uses the native require method which should be semantically the same.
https://github.com/qooxdoo/qooxdoo/pull/9

Using require directly allows debugging which is essential for developing.</thetext>

            <thetext>I commented on the pull request. &quot;should be semantically the same&quot; is a bit weak for me. I know there was a reason for doing it the way it is. Did you test with non-ASCII utf-8 source files? Did you try older node versions?</thetext>

            <thetext>Ok, I wrote some umlauts in Application.js (utf-8 encoded) and tested the application with the following node versions: 0.3.8, 0.4.9, 0.5.9, 0.6.6

    #&gt; file source/class/rs/Application.js
    source/class/rs/Application.js: UTF-8 Unicode C program text

    #&gt; node/node-v0.3.8/node source/script/rs.js
    Load runtime: 98ms
    Hello World ä ü ß!
    Main runtime: 2ms
    Finalize runtime: 0ms

It seems to work. Maybe it was another reason?</thetext>

            <thetext>Great. I think the reason was that I was concerned about require() being 
asynchronous (which could break our load dependencies), which might not be the 
case. Have you tried loading more than one file with require() where subsequent 
files rely on the contents of previous files?</thetext>

            <thetext>Merged the pull request. It looks good for the test we ran. Even a &#39;source&#39; 
version runs fine with require(), so there can&#39;t be an asynchronous issue. If 
any hidden glitch remains we will know soon enough ...

            <thetext>Yes, I tried it with multiple files, too. It works.

As far as I know require isn&#39;t asynchronous otherwise node applications would break:
   
   var connect = require(&#39;http&#39;);
   http.createServer(...);

It works great now, thanks!</thetext>
