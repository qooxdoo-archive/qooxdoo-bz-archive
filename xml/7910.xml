            <thetext>The Qx class &quot;qx.ui.table.pane.Scroller&quot; always starts a &quot;scroll timer&quot; by default with a timeout of 100 msec. Based on the comments above property &quot;scrollTimeout&quot; someone here had set the timeout to zero which is supposed to clear the timer which we interpreted as it wouldn&#39;t run. It turns out it goes off without stopping in IE10 resulting in an application that uses a lot of CPU.

Also the code executed when the timer goes off (see the _oninterval method) does nothing because it checks for member &quot;this.__updateContentPlanned&quot; which is never set to true due to commented out code in the _postponedUpdateContent method (I&#39;m using 3.0.1)

For now I subscribed to the &quot;appear&quot; event to stop the timer but I feel it can be removed from the Scroller code since it will never execute.</thetext>
